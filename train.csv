8D9gi-dxBvz-L-etXKNQzQ,"We just purchased a home in Gilbert and could not get anyone to refer an electrical company.  All outlets on the outside of the house were dead and we could not find a reset for the GFI switches.  I found Dodge Electric on Yelp and sent an email on Saturday morning about 8 am.  By 11:00  Saturday morning Preston had called and setup an appointment to check the problem.  He came to our house check the outlet,  did some troubleshooting and in about 20 minutes everything was working.  He was fantastic and I would recommend this company to everyone!",5
G-VstLqJog6xPkkbVEfGPQ,"After reading a lot of reviews it seems like Kumi's success rate depends on what you order. I'd agree on that.

By my friend's suggestion we ordered:

-the rock shrimp tempura 
-the crispy rice (blackened essentially seared tuna on top of crispy cubes of rice with ""screaming O sauce) on top
-the Hot Mess roll (with screaming O sauce) 
-the miso black cod
-a gin tonic
-a Green Geisha cocktail (Bombay Sapphire East, Cucumber, Melon, Thai Basil, Lime, Togarashi Syrup) 

--- Would DIE to eat again: 

1. The miso black cod will change your life. The fish is INSANELY tender and so tasty and the small sliver of skin was so incredibly NOM. My fried told me this cod is marinated for 2 weeks before serving and it definitely tasted that way. Every little fleck of fish meat tasted like a flavor bomb. 

2. The Hot Mess roll. That ""screaming O sauce"" is super nom and the sashimi poke all along the top of the roll totally hit the spot for me. I had been craving sashimi for awhile so this was lovely. 

3. The Green Geisha cocktail was delicious. I'm normally not a fan of cucumber but our waitress suggested it and it turned out to be a really great choice. To be honest, barely tasted the gin, which I would say is a small shame since Bombay is delicious. 

--- Would eat again but wouldn't die for: 

1. The rock shrimp tempura. This stuff is crack. It's incredibly tasty and I can see myself binge eating it by myself in a dark room while watching Netflix but wouldn't board a plane to have it again. 

2. The crispy rice. I loved the seared tuna but something about the crispy rice square didn't blend well for me with the consistency of the seared tuna. I felt like my mouth was fighting to properly blend the two while trying to ignore all the hard crispy rice bits getting stuck between my teeth. My friend really loves this dish though so maybe it's just my personal preference.",4
TYbS-lpmM4vZUyXkWP3Fow,"Oh my! I have never had a facial like this. I had with a dermatologist in the past so I was kind of ape ting the same and I saw that it was an hr long and kind of complaint in my head why so long. When I was there I was thinking I don't want it to end. 
Jeannine was my esthetician and she was knowledgeable, kind, helpful, amazing (to round it up) 
She clean my face, clean it with a warm towel, massage my shoulders, part of my back, put some sort of mask(with something that felt like silk brushing my face) then put a humidifier, and I also got arms massage. 
Got to love it.",5

skAlIpLtnFqjePQGBHcH6A,"Lac Vien just kind of popped up suddenly in the middle of no where. 

Located in a plaza where Subway and McDonalds rules (the lunch choices for people working in the area) and Lac Vien is a welcome additional in this neighbourhood.

The interior is clean, spacious and open. A lot of windows seating that overlooking Markham Road that traffic zooming along way above the speed limit. Music is ""romantic"" and ""loud"" with the dial set at Sirius XM  Love.

Pho House Special Large ($7.50) is one of the better ones in Scarborough area as the broth has a nice aroma of herbs and the beef quality was good (the beef brisket was so tender even with its thicker cut!). The soup itself though can be a little hotter maybe I should request that next time?

Iced Coffee with Condensed Milk ($3.50) is made not from the traditional metal French drip filter but from a BVB coffee machine. A perfect ""dessert"" drink for me though.

Service was fast and polite! 

Lac Vien definitely a good Vietnamese restaurant if you have some cravings for Vietnamese food. They serves more than Pho! I think I will be back to try their Phnom Penh Noodles next time!",4

qBBV5Dk2c_GV7jmVA5XOjw,Got a double full size bed room. We had reserved the room with time and when we checked in they notified us that they gave our room up which was a non smoking room so they apologized and upgraded us to a view room which had a view to the Ferris wheel. The room didn't smell that bad compared to other smoking rooms the only two complains that I have is that #1 the bathroom door is a sliding door and doesn't stay close all the way :/ which is inconveniently you're sharing with someone else. #2 the walk to the room was long and confusing I got lost once in there lol. And they have an elevator that only goes down to the pool instead of the lobby. If it's a busy weekend and you're all the way to the last floor like we were which is floor 20; expect to stop at every single floor.,4

HmuKGrmqiIAqlpCfJa-qWQ,"I order lunch from here today and it was not awesome. I had a chicken parm sandwich and fries, which is usually a go for me when I try a new place because it is really hard to screw up.....unless you haven't changed the oil in your fryer since LENT! My sandwich and fries tasted like fish fry. The fries were soggy and greasy (which happens with old oil) and my sandwich was over cooked and chewy.
The place is actually cool and in a great location. It could be a great place, but if this sandwich is any indication they need help. Probably an ok place to grab a drink before a show. 
On a side note:
When you order take out you have to walk to the back of the restaurant were the waitress pick up the food for the table and talk to what seems to be a cook who rings you out.....kinda wierd, this is usually done at the bar.

I will give them another shot and update my review later.",2

gJoIi5fM83pybiw51wi6fQ,"The reef is usually a great hangout spot for my friends and I, and usually the staff is awesome. This past sunday I went in with 4 in my group. My server was Diane and immediately we were greeted with an angry hello. All she said after that was ""drinks?"". We all ordered a round of beer (which we had to repeat the name of at least 3 times) and waited for our drinks while she talked bad about another server on duty not even 5 feet from the table. We could hear all the f-bombs she dropped within those 10 minutes of our drinks being delivered. After that she hardly checked on us, and when she did, she wasnt friendly. I asked her for another beer and she mumbled something under her breath and asked me to say it again louder. So instead dealing with an attitude like that I asked for the bill, paid, and left. Nobody should have to deal with that when being served. Possibly the worst experience I've had at a bar and definitely my worst experience here. I'm debating whether or not to even come back.",2
VR_v-K9Z-8WCJtAquQTs_w,"I met up with some work friends for some food and drinks, and this place was DEFINITELY a great choice for dinner. Their tapas selection is huge, and it's so hard to decide what you want to eat. I eventually settled on the chicken spring rolls and the salmon dumplings.

They were both crunchy, cooked to perfection, and piping hot. I loved every bit of what I ate. I also tried some of the Silk Elephant rolls my friend ordered and was a little jealous that I didn't order them for myself.

They also have a pretty decently sized wine menu, though I ended up getting the Widow's Bite to drink. It was pure alcohol.

The wait staff was incredibly friendly. Our waitress didn't speak English very well, but she was still very attentive and did her best to help us pick things out on the menu. Our plates were cleared away pretty much the minute we were finished with them, and the prices were beyond reasonable.

I would definitely come back!",5
xyp3HfJeUrhSv8dQKzD3JQ,"Bottlescrew Bill's Pub has a pub type atmosphere with a great beer selection and quality food.

The first thing I'm obligated to mention is the beer passport. This pub has so many different beers (in bottles) that they challenge you to drink 80 beers and they will add your name to the wall. Overall not too difficult a challenge if you have the time and the money. It ends up being a fun challenge between friends or some excuse to regularly meet up for beers with your friends.

Next I have to talk about the food. A lot of the reviews for the food on this page is for the older menu and not the more updated and delicious menu. I believe the food is of a quality much better than the average pub although you will have to pay a bit more for that pleasure. I would recommend the burgers (especially when it's on special) and the wings (also when they're on special). I had a salad once (although it was so long ago I cannot remember which exactly) and it was very delicious. Overall I don't think you'll be too disappointed.

Also, look for the live music whenever there is some type of holiday around!",4

The trust they were given is gone.  That would have been my first time, but instead, it will be my last.  I bought pizzas from Blaze on Horizon Ridge. Too bad Metro Pizza doesn't deliver.",1

GcRCgWIBLWUE9-I-CIJ_Kw,This place is pretty sketchy. I came here early in the am after a being at Marquee Nightclub all night. I came just to get a few lap dances and then call it a night. I asked the taxi driver to take me to a good strip club. Funny thing is the taxi driver first took me to a massage parlor. I told the dude no just want to go to a decent strip club so he brought me to Cheetas. I walked in and right away a great looking Brazilian girl walks me in sits me down asks if I want a drink I say sure so she orders one for her self and for me. No big deal we shoot the shit talk for a while then she asks if I want a lap dance. I say sure I will take one she walks me to the back. gives me a dance 20 minutes later I ask how much she tells me $250 I say you must be joking right? Next thing you know I have 2 bouncers telling me to pay up. I have no choice than to pay or probably end up beaten up and thrown in the alley. So I pay up and leave.. Not only did I pay the $250 but she also kept reaching my pockets and taking the cash that I had in my pocket as well during this dance. Talk about a bunch of thief's. This place is a joke and I wont be coming back here ever again!,1

The second time was take out and the experience with the staff was slow and unconcerned. The third time was the worst and last time I will be eating here. I dined in and had the turkey and avocado salad with no tomatoes (personal preference, no allergy). My sister was with me and ordered the same. It took 30 mins for her food to come out and it ended up having tomatoes on the salad. No silverware was provided and when we asked for it, it took quite some time to be provided. My food however took 45 mins to come out and didn't have tomatoes but it also didn't have Avocado - which is part of the name of the salad. I only had an hour lunch since it was during work hours and ended up asking them to box it to go and adding avocado. The staff didn't seem to care that the food took way longer than it should have and the guy who boxed my food seemed put out that I requested avocado to be added when boxed. Needless to say, I won't be eating here for a while, or ever again if I don't have to!",2
PundirL9n4pYjOrG_IZM2w,"I just returned from a weekend trip to Las Vegas and stayed at Aria. I was really excited as I heard it was a great hotel and was highly recommended by my friends and family.
At first I was totally awestruck with the place. Visually it was beautiful and we were taken aback by the size of the bathroom. However when I went  to take a shower I noticed a pile of blond hair stuck to the wall of the shower. Now, I am a girl and I understand we shed hair, however you would think that the housekeeping staff would clean the bathroom walls. 
We called to complain about the hair and the staff was really friendly and said that they would come take care of the situation. That evening we came back to our room to find the hair still on the walls of the shower. This time we went down to the front desk to complain but all they did was type the complaint in the computer and said they will take care of it.
In the end, nothing was taken care of,. We found a lady in the hallway who was dealing with turndown service, showed her the hair, and even though she wasnt a housekeeper, cleaned the mess for us out of the kindness of her heart.
Needless to say I was slightly disgusted everytime I went to shower. The tub looked so inviting, but never in a million years would I recommend it because I am unsure about the cleanliness of the state of the bathroom.",2

The Margaritas were delicious and the selection is pretty darn massive. I like to come here and chill out to get away for the shoulder to shoulder crowds and throw down some delicious Tequila.

V_I8X0h0eni2UZIQt4jhKw,"I have been taking my pets here for 6 years. I would not take them anywhere else. I have seen a few different vets in that time. All of them were wonderful but I would like to mention a few by name.

Dr Hughes was wonderful with my cat. He had kidney issues and asthma. I know that her care and innovative treatments both prolonged and increased the quality of his life.

Dr Holcomb has been taking care of my dogs for several years. One of my senior pups has kidney failure. When he was first diagnosed she literally sat on the floor and fed him kidney diet to see if it was a brand he would eat. She never rushes through a visit and answers all questions. She's so sweet and gentle especially to my pup who is very nervous at the vet. 

Dr Grzenda has been treating my other dog for a genetic eye disorder. She diagnosed the condition right away and I am confident that my dog is getting the best care to preserve the vision in her right eye.

The support staff is also amazing. For such a big place with lots of clients, I feel like they know me and care about my animals. 

I also want to mention the icu and the vet techs. Many vet practices are not staffed 24/7 which is one thing that gives me piece of mind about Animal Clinic Northview. I have had two animals stay in the icu to get fluids. You can visit your pet any time of day. You can tell that they all really love and care for their patients. They are very accommodating about allowing you to take your pet for a walk or just stay with them for comfort.

From the front desk to the payment department, the entire staff is top notch!

I know that several reviews talk about the cost of care. And it probably is higher than smaller practices, but I think it is very reasonable for the level of care that you get. You can also ask for an estimate for any procedure before it is done.",5

We didn't know about the Yelp check in for drinks until after we had paid for our food, but the cashier let us redeem it anyway (most places wouldn't allow that in my experience). During our meal, the employees would come by to check up on us, which doesn't happen most of the time at cafeteria-styled restaurants.

Their donuts are perfect. Fluffy freshness all around. My favorite flavors are, Boston cream, cookies and cream, pumpkin, apple cider, chocolate raspberry truffle, and the berry. Ok, pretty much all the donuts I've tried are my favorites. 

I recently ordered a pecan pie from them and it was the best pie (vegan and non-vegan) I've had. Just the right amount of filling and the crust was ""buttery"" Crisp. Even the non-vegans were impressed. Which is annoying, as if they never had bad tasting non-vegan food. PUHLEASE! 

Mind you, I ordered the pie with gluten. Just because I'm vegan doesn't mean I'm gluten free, but they did have gluten free pies available for you celiac intolerants. 

Someday I will eventually try their meals, but with all those donuts, I tend to make them my meal replacement. :X",5

Most of the park is dirt with grass around the perimeter.  I'd rather see the opposite, more grass than dirt.  

People don't seem to pick up after their dogs as I went around with the pooper scooper and picked up 3 large loads of waste without even trying.  Several waste bins are provided with several pooper scoopers available for patrons.  Waste bags are also provided near the entrances.

Access is via double gates to keep dogs from escaping.

The cookies and the scoes and coffee are delicious. It's in a fantastic location, right next to the flying fig and across the street from Great Lakes Brewery. All places I've been dying to try.

vWJBiPoPdLs4vZ6lu6x8zA,"3.75. Went for a girls dinner recently. Everything was chill and tasty. Highlights for me were the lighter, smaller plates. Great for sharing. Beet salad and manchego cheese crustini. They paced things well and server was kind. A bit slow at the start and they had no ginger beer.   Wine list is great and creative. 

Not funky or cool really. More of a grown up, if slightly laid back vibe. The lighting is warm and romantic, with wine lining the walls. Older crowd. Good place for taking parents or colleagues. Also worked well for girl chats, which is what we were up to. 

Would go again but not in a crazy rush. Nice place to have on the roster for when you fancy a wine oriented meal.",4

xmgsOU6rPQ1v0YMjkkl9dg,"I recently visited the Olive Garden location in Peoria. I have to say that this was the absolute worst visit I have EVER had in all of my years dining with this company. My mother and I exchanged our soups do salad as we have done in the past never thinking it was a problem, well we were most definitely wrong! When the server by the name of Adam came back to our table and instead of asking if we would like refills on our drinks, which we needed, he proceeded to pretty much scold us about switching soup and salad plates. He said to us and I quote ""JUST SO you know by switching plates I have to charge you, I knew it was going to happen it happens all the time I normally let it slide while at the table but JUST SO you know if you take any home or ask for refills I will have to charge you"" and it wasn't said in a quite voice either it was said loud enough so that other patrons could hear what was being said. I have never felt so humiliated while dining out ever!! There are ways to word things and get the point across in a polite and professional manner the way he handled the situation was completely uncalled for and very disrespectful. We were so embarrassed by the situation that we didn't even finish eating the soup or salad and requested boxes to box our barely touched dinners. We allowed him to box our dinner to ensure that he knew we weren't going to ""steal"" the remaining soup or salad. This experience has left such a sour taste in my mouth that I will never visit this particular location!! If I could give this location 0 stars for the service I would!",1

rP6Vm-6LcRMryS4sOQEP0w,"In my recent quest for Montreal's best Ramen places
Yakoto Yakobai was first on the to do list due to the amazing yelps. Unfortunately,the few times we tried to get in this winter the line - up was way to long. Last night,however, was the perfect opportunity and we were seated immediately in a new section of the restaurant called Ichigo Ichi. So good news for all the yelpers like me who hate long lines. Now is  your chance to try this combination Ramen house and Izakaya as they have plenty of seating. Even better there is now a cool bar serving up very nice drinks where you can sample the best of the Ramen options and order off of the menu from the new Izakaya. 

I complement the design and the decor of this entire restaurant. It is authentic and at the same time has a cool industrial look that's akin to one of the high-tech sets that you might find on one of the food channels. I think they went all out on their kitchen which you can see as you are served in the Izakaya part. It's simply great.

As for the food, the Ramen lived up to all of the great reviews. It was absolutely delicious and totally authentic. The noodles were of the highest quality and the savory and creamy broth was exceptional. Clearly the Ramen bowls here are made with a lot of care and love. The Izakaya items that we ordered were beautifully presented and had everything you would expect of the tastes of real Japanese cuisine.
The avocado and salmon salad tartare was just plain yummy and really pleasing as it was served on a glass block. It also contained some of the  tastiest and crispiest Japanese rice chips that I've ever had. We also consumed a smoked salmon salad ,artfully presented with a great variety of lettuces and veggies on the plate, as well as scrumptious chunks of  in-house on demand smoked salmon. The fried chicken Kara-age was right on the money and should be entered in a championship competition.

We went easy on the Japanese tapas so there was room for dessert. We chose a green tea tiramisu and a play on ice cream and waffles utilizing mochi and green tea ice cream. Both were satisfying, unusual and pleasing to the eye which is a good thing when one opts for dessert.

Hands-down this is the best Japanese place in Montreal.  Its affordable, cool and hip. The staff were really friendly and they try very hard to please. 

New York has Ippuddo and quite a few other Japanese greats and I'm happy to say now Montreal has this place. I hope you yelpers out there will be kind enough not to storm this place after this and the many other great reviews as I'm hoping there will be a place for me when I return sometime very soon.",5

DcXPwwlAJtOCtRTsM7sJvg,"I enjoy staying at this cozy hotel nestled at the end of a small street. There is not much surrounding this hotel within walking distance, so if your planning to tour the city, make sure and plan on getting an Uber ride or taxi lift. 

  Some of the things you first notice walking in, is the small intimate lobby with a staff member smiling, waiting to assist you. You will also notice the free chocolate tray to your left of the registration counter and cookies to the right. Also if you ask nicely, the staff provides, cold and room temperature, complimentary bottled water. I also think they provide coffee around the clock for free. 

    The rooms are okay. Fairly clean, but not very spacious. The bathroom however is a comfortable size. The pillows on the other hand are HORRIBLE, so I would highly recommend you bring your own pillow. The second you put your head down it flattens out and the ""cotton"" goes somewhere else! It defeats the purpose of trying to lay your head on something soft.

   Lastly, this hotel does offer a complimentary breakfast. I believe it starts at 7:30 am and runs till 10:30 am. The times I've been here it has always been the same:

  -Biscuits and gravy
  -waffles that you make yourself 
  -sliced sausages
  -egg and cheese omelette 
  -yogurt
  -cereal
  -orange juice
  -donuts

For the most part it's all pretty decent tasting food, with the exception of the cheese omelette.

P.S. This facility does offer a business and fitness center.",4
RhBJbcPIpqHPh8Ag88s_KQ,"Fresco is definitely one of the tastiest restaurants in Madison. It is a great place for a romantic meal or if you have friends in town looking for a more refined meal. The views are great, and being able to walk out and about the garden area is quite lovely in the summer months. I always highly recommend the restaurant to anyone visiting the area.

I want to give major props to the restaurants and it's staff for dealing with a potentially frustrating situation this past week. My parents were in town, and I've been wanting to show them how awesome Fresco is. I made a reservation for 3 at 8:15pm, but, as it is a pretty small restaurant, our table was tied up until about 8:45pm. The hostess was genuinely apologetic and was able to nab us 3 seats at the bar. She let us know that we were welcome to order whatever appetizer we wanted for free. Since we were kinda hungry, we got our free appetizer, and then also ordered a 2nd, along with some drinks. Eventually we got our table and had an awesome meal. When the bill finally came, we checked the numbers and found that we weren't charged at all for our items at the bar! 2 appetizers and 3 drinks for free! My parents and I are pretty easy-going people and were in no hurry to get seated, so the complimentary beverages and food were greatly appreciated!

Long story short: I. Love. Fresco. Though I am a bit confused that their menu states that they ""buy local,"" and none of their wines are from the state...",5
CYxFGM5GWuuNF1rvGMsYmw,"At first I was a little bummed when my husband picked the Residence Inn for our stay in Las Vegas but it turned out to be a very good stay for many reasons.
 
It was quiet at night so I could sleep and didn't hear the loud noises from the strip.

The bed was comfortable.

The shower was easy to work and didn't run out of hot water.

Very close, easy and abundant parking.

Walking distance to Monorail. (saves lots of $ on Taxis)

Free Breakfast. (They offer complimentary dinner Buffet Monday-Thursday)

The full size fridge was good for holding gallons of water.

Dog Friendly.

I do admit the decor isn't the most exciting but it seemed very clean so I wasn't afraid to sit on the furniture like I was at the Cosmopolitan where I thought I'd catch a disease or get pregnant from siting on the furniture.

The only downside I can think up at the moment was the free Wifi was slow in our room so we used a hot box.

It was a good stay I'd return!",4
hrShNh2vvy1iHp3ScLqeQQ,"I work in the area and have tried almost all the places accessible within my lunch break. Sashimi House is more or less what I expected: yet another Chinese run sushi place with nothing special, but you wouldn't mind coming for a meal anyways if you want your standard fare. Good amount of seating. Pretty good service (for a Chinese place).

I had their lunch specials. It's not the best sushi/bento box/whatever out there. It's not cheap or expensive. Everything they do is just standard. Which can be ok. With Sushi places almost as common as finding a Starbucks, this is a restaurant that I would consider only if I happened to be in the area and want sushi (unless you want the crap from a mall food court). 

I will probably come again. There's only 1 other sushi place in the area so not a lot of options if I want sushi. And the other place even more expensive.",3
qmV13SrrU268jjfUJIbt4w,"This past January I moved into a building at John and Adelaide and immediately started salivating at the sheer number of excellent food establishments around - Zupa's, Burrito Boyz, Korean BBQ and the closest yet, Corned Beef House. Last month the old House was demolished and a sign went up saying they were moving to 270 Adelaide St W, in other words, somehow closer to me. 

Now instead of a 3 minute walk, I simply have to cross the street. It's feels a bit like having your credit company tell you they've just given you an additional $10,000 in credit. Very, very dangerous. I'm actually not sure which scenario could ruin me more but I will say that I had a corned beef sandwich 3 days in a row after this happened. 

After awaking from my salty coma and finding myself not in a dream, but instead in a dream-like reality, I decided it was high time I finally wrote a review of this Toronto legend. 

The owner is a really friendly guy that greets you in a way that makes you think you may have been really good buddies way back. I'm kind of convinced we were. He's a good dude that is always patient and funny, no matter how jam packed the place is. 

Obviously, the thing to get here is a corned beef sandwich - piled high on your choice of rye with mustard and a 1/2 dill on the side - but don't shy away from the Montreal smoked meat as well. Neither sandwich will challenge your perception of what salted meats can be but both are very good, very tasty sandwiches. They taste the way a deli sandwich should. 

Although I've never tried them, the salads look huge and tasty as well so if you're a veggie that gets stuck here don't worry. The potato salad and coleslaw taste in between homemade and pretty good store-bought. 

Unfortunately, the $5 after 5pm deal didn't make it to the new location but the good news is the hours have been extended. They still have a pint and sandwich for $9-10 though I believe. 

As I finish this review I see that it's lunch time. I can see the corned beef from my window...must...fight...urge...

MENU RECOMMENDATIONS
Corned beef sandwich - light rye, regular mustard
Smoked meat sandwich - light rye, regular mustard

SERVICE NOTES
You're going to wait about 10 minutes for a sandwich and if you order the baked fries (pretty good) it'll be more like 20. Maybe call ahead for lunch take-out.

I was reluctant to right a negative review and seeing it has only 3 stars already doesnt surprise me. First off our server was AMAZING. Secondly I guess the coveted cornbread, muffins, honey butter, and biscuits are no longer a thing here. Which was a little sad. We did it big and ordered some drinks, kids meal, and 2 dinner plates. I hate hate hate sending stuff back but my veggies were absolutely soaked in whatever greasy oil it was cooked in. Since the manager wad near he was really quick to replace it with steamed veggies. But the real reason for the poor review is over battered and SUPER CHEWY country fried steak. He tried so hard to like it but I even had a bite to see what the fuss was about and I dont know if it was over cooked or just a horrible cut of meat but that got sent back too. TOTAL BUST. All this talk about how great Claim Jumpers is and we both had to be ""that guy"" and send things back. He ended up getting the jambalaya to go. The country fried steak was taken off but had to pay for the replacement which I guess it was fair. But still a total let down. Not going back.",2
KAX4KCqw9vnc57vKdDpP6Q,"Pretty stinking good tacos, mis amigos. I've heard that this fun, little taco joint is owned by the same owner as Firefly (located a hop, skip and a jump down Paradise), one of our absolute favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Why would we expect any less quality and amazing-ness from Imperial? This place absolutely exceeded our expectations.

The tacos were very thoughtfully crafted with some lovely, complementary ingredients. We tried a wide variety of their signature tacos and I don't see any reason to stray into the other entree options. The cochinita pibil taco was the only land creature I ate that day and it had intensely good flavor; I especially loved the habanero marinated onions. The grilled fish taco didn't blow me away, but was definitely solid. I loved the fried fish taco, but felt the shrimp taco was probably the winner of the day. Family said the puerco verde was a winner, as was the guacamole appetizer we had to start with.

Their tap selection was great and we were able to buy some IPAs for the table. However, I always forget how expensive Vegas is (we aren't residents) and couldn't believe paying $8-10 for a pint of craft beer. Fortunately, we came during happy hour and were able to quench our thirst with some $3 Negra Modelo on draft.

Finally, we had to get dessert. Their version of choco tacos and churros were awesome and expertly crafted, but the gold medal goes to the churros with their chocolate y whipped cream dips.

EAT TACOS AT IMPERIAL AND BECOME AUTENTICO YOURSELF!",4
Z-gNl14SbHoXlm_1-GN_ow,"First time here, had a chicken Caesar wrap and mango fresh brewed tea.  Very good lunch, fast friendly service.  The only improvement need I saw was the young man busing the tables wiped a particularly messy table onto the floor.  Your patrons don't want to walk through that nor do you want to have to clean that up at the end of the day!  Right now they don't have floor coverings on that end of the restaurant but it doesn't set a good precedent.   They have cameras so they should be able to review the activity and address it, Wednesday at 1:35.  The young man is going through training so he'll learn sooner or later.  Still a five star in my book to the fast and good food for lunch, fresh veggie's and chicken, but the Caesar dressing could have been slightly more than what was on the wrap, but it was still very good!",5

Decided to go here because I wanted to try the white chocolate orange french toast.  This was good but not awesome.  Maybe I had too high expectations after reading these reviews.  I guess I thought the white chocolate flavor was too subtle so it was more like orange french toast.  I also tried kind of a duck benedict.  Chopped duck braised with onions in a pastry.  Topped with scrambled eggs and tomato hollandaise on top.  So tasty!  Only slight complaint was that the hollandaise, although good, did not contain much tomato flavor.  Everything about this place is top notch which is what I would expect from a restaurant at the Wynn.",4

They also have pumpkin cream cheese, which was extrememly tempting, but I thought it might be too sweet. Delicious! 

They also sell delicious items such as natural and organic peanut butter mixed with dark chocolate. They've got yummy sounding salads and soups. A great place to come for lunch, or for a dozen bagels on a Saturday morning.",4

7ed0hFhR8ZP4Tb4p_0HVlg,"I love sushi and this is a good place to try as many different kinds as you can handle. The portion sizes are small so you don't get full off only one thing... Except the rice, only order the rice if you only want to eat rice it's huuuge!! The rolls are all quite similar but all taste super yummy :) The seaweed salad is fantastic and not too big which makes the perfect entrée. The waiters/waitress' are purely there to get the job done and need to be flagged down to get their attention. Students get a discount if they pay cash and if they alert the waiter/waitress beforehand and must show a valid student card at the register. Sushi comes quick after it is ordered and tastes very fresh... Overall a good place to be once you understand how to communicate with the waitress/waiters and a paper of ingredients of what is in the rolls can be acquired upon request. Yum :)",5

I have never had eyelash extensions bc I was always nervous to try - I have super sensitive eyes when using even high end mascaras, eyelash glue from falsies can irritate my eyes, and to be honest some eyelash extensions can look a bit too 'aggressive' for my taste... 

I went to see Kelley (recommended by a friend) but was still a bit nervous about the process... I told Kelley I wanted a 'natural and whispy' look, and she delivered!! My lashes look amazing and the process was so easy and relaxing (I almost fell asleep twice and joked w/her after about how the entire time I was curious if she was even doing anything bc all I could feel was tiny taps on my lashes)...

It gets pretty busy, but we had no problem getting a seat around 6pm on a week night. By 7 it was full.  Tried Yakiniku dinner (beef bento box)which was a good size portion and tasty. The okonomi yaki with beef aonori and katsubushi was something I had not tried elsewhere; think omelette with some crumbled beef on top, along with fish flakes and mayo condiment. I enjoyed it, though it reminded me of bar food and not really a meal.  Check this place out, it something a little different.",4

I must say that the Keg is not my favourite restaurant.  But I have never been to this location.  I must say ambiance wise I was pretty impressed.  It looks really nice and not chain like inside.  A place where you wouldn't be embarrassed to take a date.   In fact we saw a lot of early daters in this place.  

Pretty big with a nice lounge/bar area, this place can accommodate a large group quite easily.  The service we had was great.  We decided to have a few starters and some drinks.  We had the sliders (not bad); calamari - pretty decent; and the baked garlic shrimp - pretty yummy...but what happened to the rest of the shrimp??  For the price you pay I would have thought I would have gotten twice as many, but there were only 5 shrimp.  Yup you read right 5.  Five.  Cinq.  5.  Overall the food is overpriced which is why I'm giving it 3.5 Stars.  

I was also impressed with their drinks selection!  This would be a great place to grab drinks and chill after work.  Skip the overpriced food, feel lush in here with a dirty martini and bitch about the boss.  Ahhh..what could be better?",3
AyJwcA9mD1FXkAkFfW4s9w,"The food is great here! The portion size versus price is great as well. The portion sizes are enough for 3 people.

Would definitely recommend this restaurant.",5

Please trust me on this, do not waste your time going here. The shop was extremely old, unorganized, and extremely unprofessional. The shop owner was extremely unprofessional, used foul language, couldn't even give me a quotable price or tell me how he ran his business. He continually got on tangents as he was arguing with his longtime friend. I felt absolutely zero customer service and I felt like he knew nothing about the business world.

I asked simple questions like, what's the diagnosis charge? How do you charge here, based on hourly rate? To these simple questions, he could not give me a clear answer.

He may know a lot about Corvettes, but he certainly did not sell me on his expertise or his shops professionalism. I did not feel comfortable leaving my car there.",1
ZTG3UPyoinRGmkYs-aIWjw,This place has a great location.  But the food ranges from okay to really bad.  The fritatta is basically a small and flavourless omlette on a wrap from loblaws.  Cream of tomato soup with basil is incredibly watered down and bland.  Chunks of green don't taste like basil.  The steak sandwich was the one thing we had that wasn't noticeably bad.  Oh - one more thing - our weekday lunch took over two hours!,1

TNw-e2PYM5AGIByam3jCGw,"I wanted a posh Japanese themed outing. We were going to Madam Butterfly and I didn't want to go to just any normal sushi restaurant all dressed up. I remembered that Zen 8 was a bit more on the fancy side of things we decided to try it out.

Well. I sure hope the Teppanyaki is better than their sushi, because the whole experience we had was awful. We came early and were the only ones in the restaurant at the time but instead of getting a table we get placed at the grill - not a big deal, just weird placement. 

Our waitress takes our drink order; I get the Hello Kitty martini. Which takes over 15 minutes to get... we got our dinner order in before it even arrived.
When it did arrive it was the best part of the meal. We ordered popcorn calarmari, gyoza, spicy tuna roll and a mango roll.

The popcorn calamari was ok... but it was basically like eating deep fried batter, the gyoza had good flavour but the spicy tuna and mango roll really was a disappointment. There was a sliver of mango in two of the 6 pieces, none in the rest. The spicy tuna tasted very bland and a bit old.

PgbhT0y7mbPVP3NCMyOkEw,"Pho VP has been a great addition to the neighbourhood of Jane and Annette which is experiencing a little bit of a renaissance for restaurants.

It's a family owned Vietnamese restaurant that hits the spot if you're in the neighbourhood. We've been multiple times for lunch and dinner and the owner is always courteous and helpful. The fact that I'm a 5 minute walk away DOES NOT HURT!

Decor is modern and clean and very comfortable. They recently added alcohol to their menu as well and a Hot Pot (I believe it requires pre-ordering)

I've ordered multiple things but for me the benchmark of Vietnamese cuisine is the Pho Dac Biet (Pho Special, with all the fun bits of meat) and they have a solid offering. Only reason for not giving them 5 stars is that I wouldn't say this place is destination dining in any way but it's a great place to have in the neighbourhood and I wish them all the best.",4

They had live music that entertained us the entire evening. This place is family run and they're always stopping by to make sure everything is good. Their service is an A+

The food: Both times I've been there the food has been amazing. It's my favorite restaurant for charcuterie, which is one of my favorite meals. The mixed board comes with 3 delicious cheese and 3 yummy meats. It's also accompanied by some nuts, raspberry preserves, toasted bread, little pickles and a light salad. It's devine. The bruschetta are all amazing, I've tried all of them now and you can't go wrong. The parma ham bruschetta is my favorite though. On this last trip we also ordered the roasted goat cheese salad. The warm goat cheese is served in bread, accompanied by bacon, lemon honey and a light salad mix. It was absolutely perfect and the honey completely made the meal.

cY_pHbb9hgh4Bsum_urfbA,"This place is in a great location - trendy Yorkville. Downside is that on the lower level, downs some stairs so not that accessible if you have a stroller or, crutches etc. 

It's also a bit and really loud - or maybe I just have the misfortune of being there a few times with loud talkers? I don't know. 

The cookies and butter tarts are good. I'm going to assume it's about the coffee and not about the food. Although I wish there would be more wow factor on the sweets display and sandwiches (turkey and ham on croissants). 

Had a sandwich and although I asked that it be warmed, it was only slightly warmed on top and not through. 

They do give you a nice big cup for your tea and at nearly $4 bucks you appreciate it and drink it all!

Once we were seated, we ordered the Truffle Lobster Mac n Cheese and it was incredible. My girlfriend and I fought over the last few bites.

I ordered the Rising Sun burger, cooked medium and I added a fried egg. My girlfriend had the Gold Standard cooked the same with a fried egg as well. Suffice to say, she had major food envy, and after trying hers I could understand. The Rising Sun was in the Top 5 greatest burgers I've ever had.

yb5k6J2XrgcHNpvexgRtfw,"Over the summer, the gf and I sold the Mountains Edge home and bought in the Spring Valley area.  What I thought was going to be a minor fix up at the new home continues to be a project.  

Part of the project was painting the interior.  We previously worked with George Lopez of Design works in painting the Mountains Edge home - his bid was much lower than the competitors, completed the work on time and above average work.  Also, after finding a few touch ups, he quickly sent over a guy to finish the job.

For some reason, I opted to allow one of my go-to handymen to bid on painting the new house since he was already doing a closet add-on in the master bedroom ( never enough closet space for the gf  !) - boy, was that a big mistake !  We had a tight timeline given other work being done in the house.  After not being even close to finishing in the allotted time, I eventually fired the handyman and gave George a call.  Again, the guy brings in a big crew, gets through the work on time and at a reasonable rate.

mF42JdLHgJzbQUBW7XKVhA,"I experienced this restaurant during restaurant week and am excited to get back and experience their tasting menu. 
Service: The best I've experienced in Charlotte. Their staff is super knowledgeable, speak well and are just fun to be around. I've never had a waiter shake my hand at the end of the meal and tell me to come back. Excellent service from the hostess, to the bartender, to the bread man, to the wait staff. 
The bread cart: The guy pulled the bread cart up to the table and offered the bread of the day. He chopped some fresh herbs and added some olive oil and an amazing aroma permeated our table. The bread is heated with stones and steam and it warms the soul. 
Cocktails: They have an array of cocktails but I recommended the Trust Me cocktail. You tell the waiter what you like and don't like and let the bartender come up with a concoction. Their prices for drinks are a little steep, but what the hell. Enjoy. 
The food: Excellent creativity. All the food is locally sourced except for the citrus and the olive oil. I love the freshness of the food, not to mention my friend said it was the best pork she's ever had. The pork fell off the bone. No need for a knife.
The only sad part about this trip is that I left my favorite scarf. Although they said they'd hold it for a week, they are only open in the evenings and it's a hike to get there. I've lost a scarf for an excellent meal. Seems like a fair trade. 
I will be back!!!!",5

hGXQCpO6jJugPG0ZuErETQ,"Smith Brothers is a fairly new restaurant that opened in the Scarborough area of Toronto that boasts having some of the steaks and prime ribs in town.  We were very interested as finding an amazing steakhouse in town can be pretty tough.  We have a pretty big crowd that evening so we decided to make reservations just in case it was busy and sure enough it was pretty busy.  Even with reservations we were made to wait for 20 minutes at the front.

Once we finally got our seats, we were led to a separate room where there were were two tables of 20 people each surrounding us.  We could see that one side had already their prime ribs while the other side was still getting comfortable into their seats.  When the waiter came by, we were told that the prime ribs were all sold out.  As disappointed as that sounded, we were a little stunned by the announcement since this was a steakhouse after all.  After our table completed our orders, thirty minutes later, we could see that the table beside us who ordered after us, had prime ribs rolling out left, right and centre. 

We didn't know exactly what happened as to why they got prime ribs after we were told that they were sold out.  We all ended up ordering something for the evening however.  Since we could order any Prime Ribs themselves we went with the Prime Rib Sliders ($12.00).  With  horseradish on the side, the prime rib sliders were decent however it was certainly no Prime Rib platter meal.  The meat was sliced thinly and each slider contained about 5-6 pieces of meat.  It was almost the equivalent of eating a meat sandwich from Montreal minus the mustard. 

My Mushroom Soup actually arrived after the sliders were already all eaten.  The mushroom soup although as tasty as it was, was pretty salty the further down one went.  One could definitely taste the mushrooms finely pureed into the soup but by the time one got to the bottom of the bowl, one was reaching for the water.  We were not sure if we were suppose to mix the whole soup prior to eating but it was quite a difference of tastes from start to finish. 

I finished the meal with a Double Chocolate Orange Mousse.  It was decent but really didn't captivate me through with any wow factor to it.  If anything, it was probably a tad too sweet for me.  For the real chocolate lovers, this could be your cup of tea but for me it was probably fitting going from a real salty soup to a really sweet dessert.

Overall, it was a pretty disappointing evening. We asked the waitress afterwards as to why there was no Prime Rib Platters offered to us and were told that these items had to be ordered ahead of time.  It was too bad no one really made mention of that when we were making our reservations.  The problem with it was like a fellow retail store that went under, when a customer is there and they don't carry the stuff that one wants, then it's highly probable that the customer will never return to that place.  It certainly didn't leave a good taste in our mouths.  Like the saying goes, not too sure if we will ever make a return visit. One can't give high points if the food isn't there.",3
43vqORxMqiR3DjwcJ1IElQ,"I am sorry to report that I do not recommend this establishment.

The manager was nice and was easy to work with.  I paid for a ""fully rebuilt transmission"" on my son's car.  The manager said ""everything inside is new, except for the gears themselves.""  It cost over $2900.

13 months and 4,400 miles later, my son, now off in college three states away, experienced transmission failure.  Yes, four thousand four hundred miles later...

We had to find a local (to my son's college) transmission shop.  Upon disassembly and inspection, this second shop showed me how the previous job was not done correctly, resulting in the quick failure.  The second shop owner was questioning what had even been replaced inside the case, and showed me several very worn items that he said any decent transmission rebuild would have replaced.

The warranty was 12 months, and being three states away, I did not attempt to negotiate warranty coverage from Budget, partly because I cannot trust this show for further work.

I took a little drive to Dowtown to check it out.

I drove there and got online. once I got inside there were several lines going to the counter area. You need to see a small sign indicating what station it serves, for instance the carne asada tacos are in one line and the pork tacos are in another. 

It was really packed inside and the lines were long. Once I got my tacos it was all worth it.

I had 6 carne asada tacos (they are small) and they load them up with qacamole, cilantro and onions. Make sure you ask for the jalapeño and onion side.

I will be back here, Fyi there is another location on the strip, however the lines there are huge.

Woohoo! My order was more complicated: I'm allergic to wheat, so no pasta for me. I ordered the California burger, no bun, and asked if the chef could put chopped garlic on my French fries because I can't eat garlic bread. No problem at all, Tricia told us. And extra veggies with my burger, some ranch dressing on the side? Yes, indeed. Our meals were served hot and quickly, and that's the best beef burger I've had in forever! My fries were perfect!

Uj7uVxuRm6HV-rlYnvDC3w,"Radiant Bride is a beautiful store! They have a great selection with a great variety! The staff is so great and do their best to help you find exactly what you're looking for! In fact, I was just about to leave the store empty-handed when my consultant made a suggestion of another dress to try on based on everything I was saying about all the other dresses! The dress she suggested is now the dress I'm going to be walking down the aisle in! Clearly the staff knows how to listen and pick the perfect dress! I'm so happy I said 'yes to the dress' at Radiant Bride!",5
xWO0vMehrY79wOWrfjrrig,"First off, we got very very good service because we had booked the private dining room for our party of 10, which came with a personal waiter and busboy team and direct access to the kitchen, so no problems on service.

We started off with 3 orders of the chocolate dusted beignets, that arrived freshly fried to order with a side of two sauces: nutella and a rasberry jam. Fantastic. Fresh and airy, lightly dusted, and with sweet sauces (save the sauces for the bread you'll get later). Which by, the way, is also very good. 

We also ordered a variety of fresh baked goods. i went with the cheese danish (which was a little thicker than I was used to, but still fantastic with creamy cheese in the center), we also had the sticky buns, which was just ridiculously good. Not too dry, not too sweet, perfectly sticky.

Our table ordered a variety which included the Sourdough Waffles with Strawberry, the French Toast (signature dish), the chicken and waffles (with bacon infused batter, which basically tastes like cocaine), and the tuna salad sandwich. Everything was served with decent portions, well executed, clean, and very tasty. I found the sourdough waffles to be light and airy, served with strawberries that were sweet but with that hint of tart, so good that i didn't even have to put syrup on my waffles!

Although I found the prices to be a bit steep ($13 for mimosas and champagnes, although try the French 75 and the hibiscus champagne), we got out of there, with gratuity included, for about $40 a person. The entrees themselves are REALLY affordable, under $15 for most dishes (including $12 for french toast or waffles)

All in all, Bouchon is one of those splurge for fantastic food that borders on art experiences that define Vegas. While I found that everything was excellent, I wasn't completely blown away by anything particular that said to me ""this is the best ____ I've ever had"". Still, definitely come here and give it a try!",5
D5saTvmuxnA6mDDciGciIg,"We had the Agadashi tofu, tempura sushi, California roll and sushimi.  Agadashi tofu was excellent. The tempura sushi and California rolls were extremely fresh and very thin layer of rice. Really delicious.  I've had better sushimi but that was good too. Service is excellent.",4
HLD5aLrpZMX9PYH3e8ou5A,"After Gord and I toured the Loblaws at Maple Leaf Gardens, we walked to the Churchmouse & Firkin for supper.

It was a busy spot and we managed to grab a table by the window.

Mark was our server and he took really good care of us. He was funny and friendly. He seemed to know everyone and obviously loves his job.

Gord ordered Pad Thai (rice noodles, chicken, egg, green onions and bean sprouts all tossed in our tangy pad thai sauce). It was tasty.

I was going to order wings but Mark talked me into ordering one of the specials, Meat Lasagna and Garlic Bread. It was good too (thanks, Mark!).

We had a fun time and will definitely popped back in the next time we are in that 'hood.",4

c3yGgWV94ZCyBQOqaDDP_A,Great Mexican food. I wish there was a place like this where I live in Southern CA. Found this place last year on a trip to Sedona. Took a detour last night at Flagstaff when I was driving home from a trip to Colorado. Arrived at the restaurant a few minutes after closing. Explained to the staff that I drove down from Flagstaff & they kept the kitchen open to make my burritos. Can't say enough good things about the food & the service.,5

rilbXLcrSwxQyOhgh47Lcg,"I visit this gym almost everyday at lunch as it`s around the corner from my office.

The staff are ok, there are one or two girls at the front who are really sweet but I think it's mostly because I'm there everyday, I didn`t receive the same reception when I first started my membership. Sometimes I get some attitude when I ask for towels, and sometimes there isn't even anyone at the front desk when I arrive. I find that the staff is generally socializing amongst themselves and only cater/are friendly to the regulars. 

The space is really nice and bright. I used to go the Hillcrest location and this one has actual natural light which is great. The gym is large in size but I think they should look into adding and removing a lot of things based on popularity. There are two levels, the upstairs has a few cardio machines and the studios are upstairs for the classes, spinning and hot yoga. Everything else is downstairs. A lot of machines are getting old, I see they've replaced quite a few of them but machines like the stairmasters are always breaking down, not sure that's a fault of Goodlife's but still frustrating when you go to use one and it's broken, especially since it's such a popular machine and there are so few of them, compared to ellipticals and
 treadmills. A lot of time they run out of towels which is no big deal, but again, something that is a bit inconvenient and reduces stars from my review. 

The change rooms are decent. They are usually pretty clean, and the set-up is ok. The showers are nice and they've recently put in some shelves and new showerheads. I like to use the sauna and it's very nice and clean. 

The free weights area is always busy and I find I have a hard time finding space on the benches and squat racks. On the other hand, there are about 20 treadmills and I only see about 5-10 being used at any given time, but maybe its just depending on the time of day that I go.

Otherwise, the gym has everything you can expect to find in a gym. Some things can definitely be improved upon but overall, I don't mind spending my lunch hour here for a quick workout; it gets the job done.

Update: I increased to 3 stars because the company and some of the staff are really great, I know this was an extreme fitness and GoodLife is working to improve this club and I've seen that in updates to machines, tv's and change room additions. One staff member in particular is really fantastic, unfortunately I don't know her name but she's always working hard, I'm always greeted with a smile and she has  towels ready for me when I walk through the doors. There are also lots of amenities like a smoothie and food bar as well as on-site massage therapists and chiropractors, as well as a daycare centre.",3
2_2iyBm5Op0DDXSMw5yHQQ,"Great place for a quick bite to eat in Etobicoke. They have some great portion sizes and some great variety. We got 2 curries and a pho. Lots of different vegetarian and meat options. Some good flavouring, not the most delicious. Make sure you specify the spice  level some of our diishes came out super spicy even though no one asked how we wanted it. This place Does job when you're hungry. The service was quick and people were friendly",3

Switching here was the best decision ever.,5

Are you kidding me right now!  This place is amazing!  I wish I didn't live so far, I would drop my LVAC membership!",5
JYy69feKY5KL63BxhLTXsw,"Numerous positive Yelp reviews led us to walk over here from our nearby hotel for dinner. We were seated promptly in a booth and immediately could tell the building previously housed a Bob Evans, with the exact same lay out of tables, booths and counter I've seen many times before.

Hungry from driving all day, we looked over their lengthy southern comfort food menu. Indecisive over so many mouth-watering options, I finally decided on one of my faves, hot open-face turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy. When our waitress came back and looked at my quickly disappearing meal she said, ""I'm not even going to ask you how your meal is...you should slow down and taste it."" Yeah, it was pretty darn good, just like her sense of humor.

With a convenient location (right off I-77), wonderful food, affordable pricing and great service, I completely concur with all the other positive reviews. If you find yourself in the area and hungry for some tasty southern dining, find Cafe South and enjoy.",4

676_JGEOVBf8raadG1vhKg,"I do not like the experience I have here. I love the job that the tech does on my nails, I chose her because she was gentle and I have fybromyalgia and when I get fills my fingers hurt. The owner tries to be friendly however my experience with the only tech I will go to there is that she is very rude and her they have made fun of me for being a baby when getting my nails taken off. I always make an appointment and sometimes my tech has the look that she has forgotten or I am not on ber book so I have to wait, she says sit down. Once I was 5 mins late because I could not find parking in the garage and I walked in and she said , you late you have to come back, I was about done and the owner came outside and said come in and he could get me started, in which they didn't like I soak my nails off verses the striping with the fake nail. I wish they could understand a little kindness goes a long way. I don't live close, I drive from north central phoenix, not far but at maybe 7 miles and pass many nail salons that don't require parking in a garage and having to ask for parking validation, which they don't seem very happy to give either. Once my daughter met and drove seperate cars and when we asked for two validations they questioned us as we were lying about driving seperate. They don't have to talk to me while do my nails however find it very rude when speaking another language very loud the whole time to someone across the room and never saying a word to me specially when I try and ask how they are doing and I have been going to them for a year now.",2
ZjHdJCkRQBrLUNNc4EnW6w,Normally I don't write reviews so you won't see many other ones on the website from me but I do howover read others and I wish someone else would have wrote one about this place because if you're anything like me you work hard for your money and you don't like to throw it away which is exactly what I did with this place! I actually found this place on Groupon which normally you get what you pay for but that hasn't been my experience with Groupon. I found my last eyelash lady on there and went to her for over two years and she was amazing she took her time every time and they lasted forever. I was devasted when I fpund out she moved and had to quicly find somewhere else to go. Normally my lady would take atleast an hour and this place had me out in under 30 minutes and half of them fell out within days and the worst part is I can't contact Groupon because they told me not to purchase the Groupon and to just come in and pay them directly. So now I'm not only out the money but I have to spend more money to get these fixed. Also I can tolerate crappy customer service if the service itself is good but everything was terrible! Do yourself a favor and find somewhere else to go. The only reason why I'm giving one star is cause it won't let me give none. Thank you and good luck,1

zWIZXPj3HgHuzJQ88VvE4w,"Do not order their fries. I repeat do not order their fries. Their fries are so soggy and dark brown, they are just not great. If you visit this place make sure you are willing to wait 30 mins for your food. I was expecting a lot more from their food, considering I waited for such a long time. The food is only decent for the amount you are paying for (4.5/10). If you want thin and crispy French fries, I guarantee you there will be better options.",2

2DyUmLenVEZLlUP6j8qGdw,"Nestled between used car lots and and a dive bar, this looks like the kind of place I'd never go. Within, it contains the best Mexican food that I've had anywhere. Most places that I eat, I wonder, why is this or this even on the plate, it's unpalatable and excessive. Jalisco is the place where my wife and I literally eat all of the sauce, every drop of food and liquid on the plate. Everything tastes homemade and delicious. It it never crowded and always provides great food and quick service. We have easily eaten here over 30 times and this is our go to place when we expect a great and affordable meal. Our total ticket price for two people is usually $20 or less. I'm very happy this place is not located in Phoenix or anywhere popular as I enjoy have a private spot that no one seems to know about. 

The fish tacos are the way fish tacos should taste. Tasty, fresh, crunchy, with a midly spicy sauce that is to die for. The enchiladas have the best sauce we have ever tasted. I am not exaggerating when I say that we eat the sauce by the spoonful. My only tiny gripe is that the drink sizes are small, but hey, this is a good place to be if that's my only complaint. 

I've had meals all over Arizona from the cheapest fast food to expensive $200 per person dinners. This Mexican place puts to shame restaurants that routinely charge $30 and up per person. I'm convinced that the only reason most restaurants are open is because people have no where else to go. Jalisco earns it place.",5

As soon as the hubby brought the pizza out to the car I knew there was something wrong because it smelled really wierd..not like pizza smells,The cheese is horrible im not sure if it is cheese or what it was but it didnt taste like cheese and it was like lumpy, gross! we asked for 1/4 peperoni because the hubby doesnt eat pork and I do so I always get a few pieces with peperoni on it,but they gave us 1/2 peperoni so my hubby couldnt even eat that much.....not that he wanted to anyways! I will never go back here again and I dont know why any of these other people gave good reviews for this place, they eirther have never had pizza before in their lives or they are on crack....take your pick!",1

Huge Patio!

Services is slow and our drinks took forever to arrive, my friend almost fell asleep waiting for that

South of Temperance is only really worth 2 star but that patio worth that extra 1 star. If you into waitress in tight black mini skirt or suits and smoking cigars on patio is your thing, maybe this is a place for you! I have no interest in all the above!",3

KUluPcddau3lF_v5Hxc3CQ,"I have visited As You Wish twice, each time with my mom and favorite cousin.  The three of us went in the first time not really knowing what to expect but felt pretty sure we would create masterpieces.  Not so much.  First of all, about the place.

The shop is really nice - colorful, organized, and welcoming.  The employees are friendly and helpful and do a great job explaining everything you need to know on your first visit.  Even though the store is pretty spacious, it can be a little tight in there, especially when all the tables are full and people are milling about selecting pottery, paint, switching out water, or asking staff for help.  That said, the tables are a good height and the chairs are pretty comfortable.  Be warned, though - if you have more than three in your group, a four-top table will be a very tight squeeze.  On my second visit, my cousin's husband joined us, and between all of our pottery, 3-4 bottles of paint each, two bowls of water, brushes, sponges, and paper towels, we didn't have any room to spare.  Thankfully, we didn't spill or drop anything, but we came close.

If you're visiting for the first time and have no experience paining pottery (or painting anything more than a wall, really), and/or are lacking artistic inclination, here's some advice: don't select a ""blank canvas"" piece.  I know, all of the pottery is plain what.  What I mean is don't select a gigantic plate or a trinket box.  Select something with ""guides,"" like the cupcake or robot.  On our first visit, my cousin and I each selected a trinket box.  We both had visions of creating masterpieces.  In reality, I ended up with a black box with hints of blue and purple swirled around.  Hers was no better,  We knew better when we went back.  I went with the dragon and was able to use the raised and contoured areas as guides for paint placement.  It was so much easier than trying to design something on my own, and let me tell you - the finished product came out so nicely!

So those are my two cents.  Having a girls' pottery painting party has become tradition for us and I'm already looking forward to going back.  Even if your first pottery piece comes out like my ugly black box, it's worth it for all the laughs you'll have with the people you're with!",4

OMMT8d4FYix5azCtlZpuRw,"I REALLY like this restaurant and highly recommend it .  It is one of my favorites in Pittsburgh.  I have been a few times now and the pizza is really very unique for Pittsburgh and quite tasty.  I shared a zebra eggplant pizza yesterday along with a prosciutto pizza with arugula.  The restaurant  decor and menu has a California feel to it.  I think this is a great date place; family dinner place; and friend dinner place.  I don't understand how the reviewers below don't see how good it really is.  The service is quite good.  It may just be pizza and wine but they don't claim to be anything else and they are REALLY good at pizza and wine.  I'm not sure what the person below ordered by my friends and I spent $30 each with wine, two pizzas between the three of us, and two appetizers.  We were really full by the end.  Also recommended: go to Oh Yeah for icecream afterwards!",5
p0E9K9UWCmYmyo3wsYC0Tw,"This place is AWFUL!!! If you are looking at moving in here, save yourself the headache and do not lease an apartment from here. there is only one member of the front office staff that is ever willing to help.nothing is done correctly here. If you have any notices to enter your home, or a notice of any value that by law needs to be hand delivered, they do not hand them to you or even try too. They just stick it in the crack of the door and you gotta pray that the storms don't blow it away or it doesn't fall out.You will miss lots of important info because of this. The Biggest problem that I have had so far started a few days before I went out of town for a month. I had my hard wired in wall thermostat replaced changed because it quit working a few days before I went out of town. after I went out of town something happened to the Ac unit and the thermostat that caused the apartment to consistently heat up and cool down the apartment while I was gone, reaching temperatures of about 95 degrees. when I got home I walked in the door and noticed that the ac had quit working but the fan was still running and blowing hot air into the apartment. Now the apartment was staying consistently between 97-112 degrees inside the apartment. I called into the emergency maintenance line to have it fixed and they were unable to fix it, and then proceeded to leave me with a broken portable cooler that did not work either. I was never offered another place to stay until I came into the office complaining about it again and even at that point it seemed like they thought it was a ridiculous request to have somewhere else to stay with me and my registered companion animal. during the fixing process it took that 6 days to fix the problem and not even once did I get a phone call or update about what was going on. I was even approached one morning to a loud bang on the door from the manager of the complex, and she asked what I was doing in there, and was confused and upset that I was in there. I had some of my electronics for my home office ruined due to the consistent extreme temperature of the apartment and was told that it was a ridiculous request to have them replaced or fixed at their cost due to their lack of initiative to fix my apartment. Following shortly after I received an outstanding $800 dollar bill from SRP because the AC unit motor and fan had been running consistent causing me to have power costs of over $22 a day. I have also asked to have a portion of that paid and that has also taken weeks to even be considered. they will only pay $150 towards the bill because they say that they were never properly notified/not notified at all of any of the problems until I got home from being out of town. they also are trying to charge me for my companion animal being in the guest apartment that I stayed in and say they had to give it shampooing and a pet treatment. my dog is house trained and never pees inside and was only in the apartment at night when I was home from work. There were no stains or anything in the apartment and it wasn't even cleaned. they try to find ways to not take responsibility for their own actions. I spoke with one of the maintenance guys who said he as well as I did previously burnt ourselves on the counter tops from it being so hot in the apartment, but yet it heat doesn't affect anything or make the electric appliances run harder according to the staff. In a long sense do not rent from here they do not do their job correctly or take responsibility for their actions. I know have a power bill and electronics being fixed at my own expense. DO NOT RENT FROM HERE. You can not speak to the manager without an appointment that is usually a week or more out even if you are dropping off documents that she personally asked for.",1

r_s-5D4Jo-nzJlp7KNmSPQ,"I LOVE this place. The salon has a wonderful, trendy and comfortable atmosphere. Everyone that works there is super friendly, and they will always offer you water and there is always a tray of cookies out! 

Never again will I let anyone except Emily Claire touch my hair. I moved to San Diego and I come back to Phoenix to get my hair done! She is the best there is. When I came to her my hair was absolutely fried. The last place I was going was using way too much bleach and literally half of my highlighted hair had fallen out last time I had it done. I was in tears and thought it would take years for my hair to be soft and look nice again. Emily Clair fixed it the first time I went in. I left SO happy and I will always be grateful to her for saving my hair! I've been going to her for a year now and I have never once left unsatisfied. Not only is she an amazing hair stylist but she is AWESOME and we never run out of things to talk about.

Love love love her and love love love the salon. You really cannot go wrong if you go to The Root. My mom and sister both go there and have other people do their hair and they are just as happy as I am. I just can't say enough good things about this place. If your hair is fragile and thin (like mine), this is the place you should go. I had brown hair and the place I went before made my hair tangly and coarse, and when I switched, I stayed blonde, but now it's a prettier more dynamic color that I get complements on it all the time. Plus it's just as soft as my hair was before I started dying it (they do this conditioning treatment that is like magic). Plus their prices are awesome, I've been to places before that charge way more and aren't half as good. 

Five stars is not even enough. I'd give them 10 if I could.",5

Our server was very attentive and spoke fluent English, which most ethnic restaurants lack. Communication is key and they nailed it. She recommended the spicy beef noodle instead of the typical pho and it was the most tasteful food I've had in a long time. The broth had a nice heat and red color and the vegetable that came with it was very fresh. 

My husband got the beef vermicelli stir fry. He did not talk to me the whole time we were there, their food was that good. We just kept eating. At first we thought the portion was too big but when we started, we couldn't stop.

Once we entered the place, it was welcoming. The tables and chairs don't look so old as the outside. The waitress was attentive and nice. 

It came with four appetizers which I love 3 of them. I'm not a kimchi fan. I ordered soft tofu with oysters. I got three small oysters, definitely frozen. I was hoping it would be fresh. It came with purple rice which was nice, but not hot enough. 

My partner had the chicken cutlet. It was crispy and tender. I would have like to see it with some steam veggies to compliment the dish. It's all deep fried then! 

Verdict:  it was just like any other Korean restos that I go to. Nothing special. It was a drive since I don't like in Etobicoke. If I'm in the area, I don't mind going there to try their other main dishes.",4

Unfortunately he was away but referred me to Orrin Mullennax. My wife had identified a BMW 5 Series they had on the lot and we made an appointment to come drive it. Orrin had the car waiting up front and ready for us before the appointment. Long story short, we bought the car and it's amazing. Orrin was really patient and was always available for me when i had questions. This purchase took about a week to finalize due to my schedule but Orrin was really cool the whole time. The finance Manager Shawntelle Adler was great as well. Very thorough and easy experience. This dealership was a pleasure to deal with.",5

y1ZgMWiAXsuYiPfvo0vvtw,"Mixed experience at best - I debated giving two stars. I don't plan on returning.

Pros: My gluten-free buckwheat crepe was quite tasty and the filling had fresh, properly cooked ingredients. Even eggs were perfectly done and the arugula was unbruised. When I needed help, the manager was great.

Cons: Sides were meh. The au gratin that my husband had apparently tasted like it came from a frozen foods section, not a restaurant.

However, service was the real problem.

1) Weeks before eating here, I walked in to discuss gluten-free options when I happened to be in the area. I was told that they do gluten-free orders frequently (as you'd expect since they carry a gluten-free crepe batter) and was told that they can make anything on the menu without gluten! This sounded too good to be true but the hostess insisted that this was the case. Of course, it isn't true, and I have no idea why she said so.

2) When I visited, they nearly gave up our table because they couldn't find us when it was ready. Where were we? Sitting in the waiting chairs right in front of them! Thank goodness one of our party went up to check up on them. Again, I have no idea why this happened.

3) The waitress had a remarkable amount of trouble understanding my gluten-free order. I'd ask a question about whether an item was gluten-free, and she'd respond by saying something about the item that had nothing to do with whether it contains gluten. This went on for several menu items until she started to say something about how they didn't really do gluten-free crepes and that maybe I should look at other menu items, which of course is not true and I have no idea why she said it. We finally asked for her to get a manager or chef to recommend gluten-free options. When the manager came, he was great at answering my questions and making basic allergy accommodations the way most restaurants do. Now, while it's a bit silly for a server not to know which items are gluten-free in a restaurant that's gone to the trouble of having a special gluten-free crepe batter, I don't really have a problem with a server not having all that memorized. The problem was that she wasn't offering to help us figure things out or check and, indeed, she didn't seem to understand basic questions well enough to give an on-topic answer! Yet again, I have no idea what was going on with that.",3

The highlight was the tuna tartare. Crispy jalapenos gave it an excellent spice and texture and the sauce was excellent. The lychee martinis are like candy.

DPdIK_ODOuPs3JNvZ-s56A,"After getting tired of my wife bugging me forever to take her here, we finally went on Mothers Day. I wish I had listened sooner as this place is great! No wait and no need for reservations unlike the Cheesecake Factory across the street which had a 2 to 3 hour wait!

Here's how it works:

1. Once seated a server comes and takes your drinks orders and hands each of you a bowl.

2. You go up to first station, the meat station and add as little or as much chicken, steak, pork, shrimp or imitation crab meat as you want. Ignore the ""pick one meat only "" sign. You can get all the meat available if you want. There are also lo mein and rice noodles available at the station 

3. Then you go to the vegetable station and add as much spinach, broccoli, snap peas, onions, mushrooms, water chestnuts, tomatoes, carrot and more to your bowl.

4. Next you go to the sauce and seasonings station and pick from over twenty choices.

5. Finally you go over to grill. You will be given a number from 1 to 10. The number you get is were you go and place your bowl and sauce(s) and wait while your food is cooked. Be sure to tip the cooks. They will give you a cheer when you do.

6. And last but not least sit and enjoy. 

Once you have your food your server will offer you white or brown rice, lettuce wraps or tortillas to go with your meal.

One bowl cost $8.99 for adults and $6.49 for kids 3 to 11, but unlimited bowls for adults are just $2 more and the second kids bowl is free. Even if you're full off the first bowl go through again and take it home for lunch the next day.

Our server Luke was great. He explained to us how everything worked. We each started off with a tasty Raspberry Lemon Aid.

For my first bowl I had lo mein, steak, mushrooms, onion, broccoli and yellow, red and green peppers. The cooks were really nice and talked to each person while they cooked there food. They teased us about it being our first time there.
Let me tell you, the food was delicious! Everything was fresh and tasted so good!

For my second bowl I had lo mein, chicken, shrimp, steak, mushrooms, onion, broccoli and yellow, red and green peppers. It was just as good as the first. I could only eat about a quarter of it and took the rest for lunch the next day.

They also offer appetizers and desserts and have a full bar.

Insider tip: Be sure to check in using the Yelp app to get $2 off of a bowl and also to sign up for Club Mongo for future discounts and free meals.",5

pF9_q8DIwqj3TFUHFnBs7Q,"This is the my first time eating at this place.  I went there for lunch and was surprised at how packed this place was.  I had to try their HK style noodle soup and their wonton soup.  For under $4, there were quite a few wontons in the bowl.  But wontons were just okay, the wontons at Noodle Palace actually tasted better. 
 
The HK style combo noodle soup on the other hand was very flavourful.  The broth was quite tasty.  The last time I had this type of combo noodle soup was over 20 years ago back in HK.  I ordered three additional toppings for the noodle soup - pork skin, beef ball and beef stew.  I expected a decent bowl of noodle soup, but what I got instead was a big bowl with not too much toppings inside.  I was a little disappointed with the portion size.   But because the broth is so good, I will definitely come back for more.  

Next time I will also try their BBQ meats.",4
e2v3JEWKiJGQIsTePYCt6A,"Say what you want about Kool Haus, but it's a decent place to see a show. It isn't the greatest of venues, but thankfully, it isn't like the Sound Academy. *Shudder*

What Kool Haus has to offer is its good acoustics, lighting and stage. I've seen a lot of shows over the years (Queens of the Stone Age, The Black Crowes, Peaches, Eagles of Death Metal), and I've rarely left disappointed because the venue didn't meet my expectations. It wasn't until recently that I was reminded at how decent the place was when I saw The Black Keys. 

I found a spot near the edge of the stage, I still had a great view of the show. The stage is big and high enough that you can see the show from wherever you're located, provided that no one over six feet tall stands in front of you. Inevitably, this always happens to me. Also, the speakers weren't situated right there, which meant that by the end of the night my ears weren't ringing loudly (always wear earplugs, kids!). The overall sound and lighting were great. I don't know if the duo from Akron, OH, brought their own lighting and sound guy, but I have no complaints about it.

Kool Haus is also known as The Guvernment, which is a club, and on weekends, the club kids ascend upon it. I can't tell you how the venue is during these nights because I don't club anymore. 

But as someone who did attend club nights when Kool Haus was known as the Warehouse and R.P.M., it was one of the best club venues in the city. It offered good sound, ""great music"" (when I liked techno) by top d.j.'s in the city, and none of this designer chic, loungey, Ibiza-esque atmosphere that a lot of clubs nowadays administer. Yawn.

The location isn't convenient but it's accessible. In the summer months, it's a 20 minute walk from King Station; 15 minutes if you're a fast walker. It's a relatively safe walk and properly lit thanks to the condo developments nearby. The walk along Queen's Quay is fine though spotty but if you're seeing a show there, you won't be the only one trekking back to Union Station by foot. 

Alternatively, you can take the 6 Bay bus that will drop you off at the corner of Queen's Quay and Jarvis, just on the other side of Kool Haus' entrance. It will also take you to Union. I don't know how much parking is as I don't drive but no doubt it must be expensive.

It's not a surprise that the drinks here are ridiculously overpriced. You pay $8.50 for a Smirnoff ice, a few bucks less for a domestic beer. But what is ridiculous is paying $4 for water! For many years I kept my plastic water bottle with label 'The Guvernment' on it as a reminder of how much distilled tap water cost me when I was thirsty. 

My best advice: save your cash on merchandise from your favourite band or for the cab fare to get home safe and sound.",3

Renting from them, with their knowledgeable, non-pushy staff was a pleasure. The process was simple and the instruments (trumpet and a flute) arrived quickly. We opted for the middle grade and were pleasantly surprised by the quality and condition of the instruments.
  After a couple of years of renting my kids no longer needed the rentals so I sent them back, no hassles. I had some shipping issues but working them out with them was an absolute pleasure. I highly recommend their service to anyone looking to rent an instrument, especially for the longer term, since all rentals are rent to own at the end of which you get a brand new instrument to keep. I wouldn't hesitate to turn to them for any future musical rental needs I might have.",5
aO8-RVcbFSpcyamFFPWaBA,"You take one of the most gorgeous pieces of land in Calgary and then pair it with top notch local food, fine service, a lush patio and a strong dash of that classic Canadian cottage look and then you somehow can the kitsch and keep it tasteful,  - You've got yourself the River Café.

While the interior is really quite comfortable, warm with plenty of wood, log framed chairs and half-canoe shelves giving it and unmistakably Canadian feel, what really shines at the River Café is the patio. If you catch Calgary on that rare occasion where the ground isn't frozen, the wind isn't blowing, or the whole island isn't underwater (not to make light, I'm beyond impressed at your resilience, River Café, and I'm beyond happy to have you a part of Calgary again.) make sure you get a spot out side. Look around you! You're on an incredible island park in the middle of a skyscraper clad city and then you get to immerse yourself in the wild garden feel of a stone patio with log railings, plenty of plants and blankets ready for you if you get a chill.  Enjoy this inner-city wilderness retreat. Breathe. Sip some wine and savour the really top notch food.

I find the prices fair and the food worthy of any restaurant. While yes, the scenery is gorgeous, I believe River Café stands on its own. While yes, she's gorgeous, she's got the smarts and the personality to back it all up. River Café is one fine patio pick for corporate lunches, tourist expeditions and also for locals to meet up with good friends over a tasty meal.

We came here due to a coupon we had... that is how we try new places.
We both had the meat loaf Thursday special, I wish we would have ordered one meat loaf and one sandwich, we were considering the spicy chicken sandwich.

Dinner was OK, I am not a big fan of meat loaf either, not sure why I decided on it, but it has bacon on top and that made for it. It was smothered on gravy, which I do not like much either, came with mashed potatoes and green beans (lately I eat my green beans lightly sauteed, so these felt way over cooked, but they were still good, with bacon and onion... so far all this is 3 stars or so.

However, we noticed the menu said they make their home made chili beans with chorizo, and since my hubby is a big fan of chorizo, we decided to order a cup just to give it a try. I believe it was $3.5 for a cup, and $5.99 for a bowl.

Well, the chili arrives and it is bigger than we expected, that was between 1.5 or 2 cups... it had cheese on top and raw onions. It looked good, and very reasonable portion... actually we were both thinking maybe we mistakenly got a bowl instead of a cup. Hubby had like half and he loved it. He said 5 stars out of 5. He saved the leftovers for a breakfast burrito : )

Lastly, our server Jill was very friendly and attentive.

This place is pretty close to perfect for an inexpensive get away. Should we ever come to Phoenix again we definitely plan on staying here.",4

Wonderful meal, flavorful steak, there's a dollop of straight horseradish already sittin in the creamy, which is just way I like it. Oh and the sourdough bread they give you is fresh and yummy.  Had a great night!",5
mC7htaw0RZVfASFUc1DUrA,"Overrated. Big time.

To be fair, I do not like deep dish or Chicago style pizza. But I figured I would see if I had changed my mind. I haven't.

Wait is WAY too long, pizza is boring and you may as well eat bread with sauce and cheese on the side. 

Will not be visiting again.",2

TeJCju6yoHmkMmHUJaGktQ,"I have 2 rescue dogs and was at wit's end up with the tension just overall imbalance it brought into my human relationship. Since my husband and I had completely different ideas on how to discipline them; he is stern/intimidating and I'm the loving/nurturing one, we just could not see eye to eye and it was evident we were not getting anywhere. 

One of our dogs is a 1 year old puppy who, although very sweet and playful, did not obey proper boundaries (jumping up on the couch, being pushy and basically getting away with anything she wanted). The other is a 6 year old who suffers separation anxiety and overall nervousness esp. around my husband. I recognized that things were just completely imbalanced with our family and was desperate to find help and harmony. 

I specifically wanted someone who could teach us calm assertiveness and positive reinforcement to help us with their behavior and reestablish ""pack"" leadership (we did NOT want someone to use choke/pinch collars or any type of physical force). 

I quickly learned from our trainer, Doug, that my husband and I were NOT in control. That the dogs viewed us a THEIR followers. Needless to say, we were amazed at how much we were able to accomplish simply using body language, calm energy and basically showing the dogs that WE were their leaders and to finally submit and trust us. We witnessed the dogs physically get to the point of submission and a state of overall ""calm."" We've still got a long road ahead of us, but Doug gave us the tools to get our dogs to a better place.We both learned so much about paying attention to all of the subtle cues the dogs gave us in their body language, eye contact, everything. My husband and I are finally supporting each other with the dogs and I couldn't be happier. I highly recommend ""The DOuG Trainer"" if you want to learn about yourself and if you're open to changing your own behavior too.",5
gsBfOhaWfrvpd5_Vi--TLg,We went for our 2 year anniversary and had such an amazing experience! It was our second time visiting and we will absolutely be here every time to celebrate any occasion. The team wrote us card to celebrate our special day and everyone that we met in the restaurant greeted us with warm smile. Of course the foods are great too. Thank you so much Americana for memorable experience and great service.,5

XHo_gAWCSII4lTEBKQF6fg,"I am loving my new med spa! I had been looking for a new spa for facials and I found the right place. I have been seeing Melissa for the past few months and she has been amazing. Having previously worked at a dermatologist's office, she knew of different medications I had been on and gave me recommendations of treatments she was able to offer me to help me with my skin issues. I have been getting IPL Photofacial as well as a deep cleansing treatment with her and my skin feels (and looks) so much better. She makes me feel comfortable and explains to me everything she's doing. Melissa is easy to book through text or by phone and has evening availability which is perfect for my work schedule.

The spa has complimentary water and snacks while you wait for your appointment in a comfortable seating area. The prices are reasonable as some treatments can cost a fortune at other places. They often have monthly specials which helps out a lot and I will often buy multiple of a treatment. I like this place, too since they offer so many different types of treatment options!",5

N0TauFOLJoD3M88Dfv_VCg,"I've been coming here for years. It's not great, but it's been alright and they've usually treated me well enough. However, tonight I left the club and found that there was a giant limo illegally parked right behind my car and a bunch of others. The driver parked there despite the fact that there are multiple dedicated parking spots for limos. I couldn't get my car out and called the club for help. I was told it would be taken care of immediately. Nothing happened for 10 minutes. I went and spoke with the doorman, who was friendly enough. I was basically told that it was some promoter who'd decided to park there and that they wouldn't do anything about it. The implication was clearly that I was less important than whoever this person who needlessly parked illegally was. About 20 minutes later, after about 30 minutes of waiting, I saw that the limo had moved - no one told me, no one came to apologize. Fair enough Hustler Club, you've lost yourself a customer.",1

j02XrxJk1AQCN1bp86uQlg,"I like Ace Hardware stores. Most are small-ish but friendly and responsive to the needs of the average homeowner; glass cutting and re-screening services, yard and garden rentals conveniently just down the street. For these and other reasons I expect to spend a little more at Ace than at the blue or orange great-crate stores and usually the money-for-goods exchange is worth the small premium.
Most Ace's have a special place in the community, a specific need or niche where they lineup nicely. Alas, my current projects are rather involved and the ones not handled by professional contractors are better suited to the home improvement world. This particular store don't really mesh on any level except the free popcorn bit which is a bit of a let down because I prefer hardware stores to the other.",3
kyVXSf4xfUElrEZCi6oIdA,"This place was better when it first opened. I used to go a lot but then it just went downhill.

I highly recommend Wave House Cleaning and Jamie!",5
yE60AtfgD72gRYAzxPki5w,"I went on a Thursday. It was $10 for ladies to get in, so I found that very reasonable. On Fridays it's $20 for ladies. It wasn't very packed on Thursday, which I enjoyed. I looove that they have salt water pools, and no kids allowed of course 21+. The DJ was alright, played a lot of house at first, then some hip hop. It was pretty loud, and you have to shout a little to talk to eachother, which is fine with me. 

I ordered a bloody mary and a fiji water at the bar, it was about $25. That bloody mary was soooo damn tasty, I wasn't even mad about the price. The bartender was also very friendly. I believe his name was Alex, although I could be mistaken. But he was great, I really appreciated the excellent service. I cannot stand when you go to a place and employees have the nerve to act stuck up when I'm in there spending money. 

Which brings me to those GD raunchy ass towel boys (aka security). Jeezus folks, super cop status, seriously? They're like pumped up d-bags who want to police everyone for no good reason. Did I mention it took almost 20 minutes to get into the place?! I only brought myself, but some people had bags of stuff. They searched eeeeverything!! 

They made everyone dump out all their liquids, even contact lense fluid and hand sanitizer! They said it could be drugs, (GHB) what is this the 90's? I found it hilarious. The place wasn't even busy. My best friend was not impressed and completely hated the place before we even got inside. We didn't stay long. They lose two stars from me for the douchey security guards, and long wait.  

Other than that it's a pretty cool place. But the service was horrible. If it wasn't for the super sweet bartender, good drink, and one friendly bouncer, I'd have had to start some shit up in that MF!",3

It was an awesome experience because everyone is eating with a bib and gloves on. I had chicken wings so it wasn't so bad for me. The Cajun fries are delicious and would definitely go back just for the fries

I love how the waitress filled up my water everything it was empty which is a major plus. They helped get the machine asap which I like so I can just pay and get out. 

Parking is kinda tough if it's full you'll b looking for parking. Evening time it's too packed so that's why going first thing on a Saturday is a pretty good idea!",5

Q-53DbqYebDBTri2Rl3gOg,"I'm in South Carolina and I wanted barbecue! So I looked around and came across this place. There's nothing fancy about this place, just straight up Western ""looking"" atmosphere with lots of wood everywhere and smug paintings on the wall. Thursdays are 1/2 off wine bottles so you know I got one of them! When I come to barbecue places or smokehouse restaurants I ALWAYS get the combo! So here I got the ""Well Fed"" portion of chopped pork, beef brisket, chopped chicken and hickory smoked sausage. I had macaroni & cheese and steamed vegetables as my sides. Everything was amazing. Fresh, tender, full of flavor, hot and just good. I will certainly come back here to feast!",5
KTgL29Gz9HKOyx7go20vzA,"This place is no joke. They are the experts on meatballs. This would definitely be a guilty pleasure if I was in the area more often, I recommend it. Variations of meatballs to suit most dietary restrictions and sauces for all tastes. The mac and cheese and the fried pickles are some of the apps/sides my group and I got and they were gone in seconds. The restaurant also has this rugged barn feel to it that suits the environment. Definitely should check this place out if in the neighborhood.",5

Everything we had was very good.  Service, however, was practically nonexistent, although the servers seemed to be having a great time talking amongst themselves.  We had to flag someone down for water refills, for our bill, to pay our bill... you get the idea.  But for a late-night dessert spot right downtown, it was a winner overall.",4
DwvSxscO9lR0qnwUret35A,Here for the first time and we are extremely disappointed. Yuengling on tap 16 oz 5 bucks.  Very over priced. Pizza was under cooked and the Cesar salad was pathetic.

While the wait was a little longer than expected(20 mins) they did advertise you could check-in online so you didn't have to wait. The hair dressers were very friendly and pretty quick. Good job on a hair cut at a budget price. Not much you can complain about. For guys - fast/ efficient way to get groomed. Next time we will be trying the online check-in though.,3
YvhpJFRpRZTBdfD1NcpaHA,"Phenomenal experience! Booked the private room for my bachelorette party. The service was impeccable and the food was on point and beyond reasonably priced for a 3 course meal and drinks for 15 people. 

The restaurant itself is pretty casual and lacked the ambiance that I would have liked. Another downside is that there are no bathrooms on site and you have to walk through the casino to get to the nearest one. This was terrible for me as I had to use the bathroom several times during dinner and had on an outfit that required assistance in order to do so. Faults and all, I still think that you should consider this restaurant for a special occasion or just a darn fine meal.",5

It was indeed a small place, but a very cute taco shop. we were pretty surprised how short the menu is, however, everything on the menu looks so appetizing to me. I ordered three diff tacos: daily special (pork, cucumber, hoisin sauce, and cilantro), pollo, and carne molida. Mmm my favorite one is probably the carne Molida because I'm a big fan of spicy food. The other two were very tasty as well. 
We sat at the bar to eat our tacos. At first we came in there aren't many people, about 4 people. However, there were only one guy making tacos. We had to wait awhile for him to take our orders. After we got our orders in, the food came pretty quickly. While we were eating, I found that many people come in and out very rapidly. A lot of people got to go tacos. The price is very reasonable. Overall, My stomach was very content :) We both love it and will definitely come back again.",5

The venue is pretty small with an equally small menu.  I was expecting more options.  We ordered waffles with bacon and The Five Spot (breakfast sandwich).  Both were very good.  Coffee was from cave creek and was pretty good as well.

Service was great.  Our server was upbeat and friendly.  She told me how much she loved working there and I can see she was sincere.  

I do plan on coming back here.  I grade them a solid A.",4

2. Pizza size - 1-person pizza.

3. Price - $5-6 + tax.

4. Efficiency - Hot fresh pizza ready to pick up within 5 minutes.

5. Simple - You pick, you pay, you pick it up and eat it. When you are ready, they are ready to serve you.

6. Inspiring stories and quotes on the inside of the pizza box. Gives a personal touch. Very special indeed. Never seen it anywhere else.

I don't understand the logic in that. Come before 6 so I do then they refuse because it's after 530. They referred me to come back the next day, or to try and make it to Avondale in time, before 6... because of course they don't take new patients after 6 either... total bull crap....

The food is extremely overpriced and the coffee is quite disappointing. I also noticed there were ants in the front of the store which leads me to think there are more elsewhere. I informed the server of the ants where she went to tell the owner and I heard him say ""what would you like me to do about it"". If this is how he plans on running a business I feel truly sorry for anyone working under him. I got to talking to the server who was the sweetest girl I've met in a long time. She said she didn't want to talk badly of the business or the owner but I pressed for more information and she explained how the owner treats them poorly. He even takes money from their tips which is downright outrageous. I would never in my life recommend this establishment to anyone.",1

Interesting, but not overcomplicated.  The prices are amazing with every sandwich at $5ish or less.  I also love their soups and salads.  I recommend this to anyone who likes to pay reasonable prices for things that are delicious.",5

My standard order is a double-double with fries and a chocolate shake- sometimes I'll splurge with an order of cheesy fries instead (I know there's a secret menu, but I don't like anything but cheese on my burger). While the food is great, the place is always packed (because, let's face it, everyone loves In 'N Out). If you plan on dining in, you have to play a game of stalking tables. You know, place your order and then prowl around the dining area waiting for some unsuspecting customers to finish eating and then snatch up their table (preferably after they get up- you don't want to be too over zealous). Crowded dining area aside, this place is great and I look forward to going back.",5

The salad was good. Just as I remember. Nothing spectacular, but subsided my craving. I was alone so I just grabbed a seat at the bar. Everyone was really helpful and the bartender is lovely, but she seems so overwhelmed having 6 patrons at the bar. I think she may have had another bartop table, but absolutely nothing crazy. A bartender shouldn't be weeded with so little going on. Maybe she was just having an off day, but I think it's a safe to suggest she's in the wrong field. 
I'll come back again when I have another craving but probably not soon. The happy hour drinks are a petty good deal of you want to grab a quick drink. Anyway, good luck!!!",3

Pros: You can peruse the menu at your leisure while you wait. Its posted outside. Dim lighting...I love me some romantic mood lighting on dates. My dish of choice is the Louisiana chicken. The chicken is fried to perfection and the pasta is delightful. They serve you bread when you are seated which is warm and delicious. The cheesecake. OMG the cheesecake.

My favorite is...the BDSM number! So darn sexy and really pushing the limits of sexuality. Truly a dance number to look forward to! 

I have seen the show many times throughout their 30 year run in Las Vegas. And I still enjoy going  to see it!

As a former dancer/ showgirl in Las Vegas, I have danced and seen all the great shows...Crazy Girls is a favorite and I am always impressed.

Truly a Las Vegas Iconic show. I highly recommend to all! You will be happy to be a part of this experience.

Small theater, no alcohol, nice doormen and wait staff. After the show you can meet the ladies and take photos. They are all so sweet, nice and happy to be there. Very interactive show.

There are a few KBBQ places in our area but my wife decided on Mot Na Son after reading a few reviews. I think the clincher was that the restaurant does not use MSG in their soups. 

Mot Na Son is located in a stretch of Yonge St. near other Korean and Asian restaurants. The inside is very small and the decor is very plain. Just be aware that they don't have good ventilation and you can smell the BBQ smell throughout the place. 

We got there around 6:30pm and the place was busy. Thankfully, there was an empty table because more people came after us and we would had to wait. 

We ordered the Samgyupsal combo for 2 that came with the pork belly, a stew and rice. We decided to get the kimchijigae. I don't feel like the combo was cheap but the food was very good. It was roughly around $47 for this combo. I believe the reviews that my wife were wrong and they do use MSG on their stews. I'm not 100% sure though. 

There were two people working that night. An older gentleman who seemed to be the owner and a young female waitress. Even though it was busy, we were being attended. BTW, I can see why people directed some of the criticisms at the older gentleman for being a bit intrusive. I also got ""schooled"" in the finer points of KBBQ while cooking by him. I didn't mind him but I can see that it would upset some people. 

The food is good but the price and the lack of ventilation brings the rating down. Make sure not to wear anything nice as you would have the BBQ smell after dinner. 

Recommended with certain conditions.",3

Convenient location for those that live in this area - there's a breakfast place, a Bulk Barn, and a Pizza Pizza nearby amongst the notable. 

Why I prefer this to some of the others? Fresh fish.
They also carry octopus, anchovies and other seafood for decent prices.

However, this store gets busy so I have some advice for the management:
1. Clean it up - the produce section is filthy!
2. Manage your displays - the guys do a half-assed job so the displays are stacked a little all over the place.
3. Where are your experiential sales people on weekends? Every other store has them! Get some!!",3

I thought it was a little strange to have to pay upfront once you check in and then the second after the massage is over, i.e. before you even leave the room, you're asked to fill out the ticket for gratuity right away.

We did 1 hour of the dune buggy and it was way plenty of time!!! If it is your first time 30 minutes is perfect. I know it sounds ridiculous to spend 30 minutes out of the 4 hours you're there but the drive is so tiring you will be okay with 30. Either way you can upgrade if you're having fun!  

DO NOT PLAN TO DRIVE IF YOU ARE UNDER 5'4ft!!!!!!!!

For the 1hr buggy ride, half way between the driver and passengers have an option to switch. All the girls in my group had trouble driving the buggy because they couldn't reach the pedals!! I didn't get to ride it because I'm 4'11 and knew i would stress out the whole time. They give you cushion but they are NOT enough!! You will be sliding everywhere and they are cheap foam. My bf is also 5'6 and his foot cramped a lot because he was pushing the gas pedal that he couldn't reach. At one point he took off his shirt to put behind his back so it could give him a little bit more support.

Two years ago, when we visited Las Vegas for our honeymoon, we were a bit disappointed that they were renovating and Big Elvis wasn't playing (I believe this was when he was at Harrah's).  During this past trip to celebrate my husband's birthday, I was again sad to learn that he wasn't performing again.

If you're a huge Elvis fan, this is one stop that I recommend to place on your list of to-do's in Vegas. 

Let me start with the voice. 
As a huge Elvis fan in my own right, an Elvis impersonator, and own a collection of Elvis paraphernalia, I say in my honest opinion, this guy is better than most Elvis impersonators in Vegas. Having been born in the 80's, I couldn't get to see the King of Rock and Roll in person. However, after my wife say that this guy has solid reviews, I had to see for myself. I closed my eyes as he was singing and I felt like I was listening to one of the many Elvis concerts I have on DVD. 

There were segments in his act where he called up audience members to perform and the audience would pick the winner. I went up three times, and won all three!! Another great aspect of the show is where he would ask for requests. I actually met him in the back and requested, Heart of Rome. For those of you who are not familiar with Elvis' songs, this song is very hard to sing; unless you have the range to do it from Baritone during the verses and going up an octave higher with each chorus! He did it; quite well although his voice did break with the last chorus, but I couldn't blame him. That song is hard!

If you consider yourself to be an Elvis fan, this is an essential stop in Vegas. Happy yelping!!",5

If you like sweet spicy food, this place is for you. However it does taste similar to something from bourbon street grill but more expensive. The fried rice is extremely oily. I know it's fried but I've never seen fried rice glisten so much. The fried chicken wings are also one of the most expensive I've seen. This is one of the more pricey Korean restaurants in the area.",3

Well my boyfriend and I walked in on a sat night it was packed and I could tell the staff was stressed, the host (I think) was sweating but we were seated at the only available table and immediately felt welcome. The food took a little longer than expected but only due to the obvious fact they were short handed. There was only one waitress to 1O tables.
The food was amazing spicy but not to much for a mild spice girl, I had the kimichi (spelling not to sure)with tuna at a 1 on the spice scale and my boyfriend had the beef bolgogi at a 2 on the spice scale which he loved and got plenty of!

GjKRcNiZIViCC0hozTaJEw,"My friend works at Lavo and the company that owns them was having a soft opening of Marquee Dayclub, and employees were invited as well as family and friends. (I think that's what it was). When we arrived it was packed! It started at 2pm and we got there around 3:20. We walked around for a bit, stopped at the bar with our 2 tickets for free drinks. I had a margarita and she had a lemon and vodka type drink.  

Then we got SO lucky! She found someone she knew who escorted us to a table under the tent. Someone else came over and asked what we'd like to eat. They sent over a tray of fresh  fruit while we were ordering food and drinks. ( I really like it when I'm treated like a high-roller). They offered us a bottle, but I was driving and going to Embers that night, I only wanted a mojito. My friend wanted one too so they send over a carafe of mojito's. 

For food we had:  Ahi tuna over salad. The salad had cold blanched snow peas. WOW, insanely delicious. Next time I see them, I'm buying them and putting them in salads. WOOOOOW.
There were cherry tomatoes, avocado and artichokes in the salad too. The dressing was very good as well. We also had the fish tacos'. They were delicious too. We had a side of fries to and they were nicely seasoned. 

For drink: Margarita and mojito. The mojito was definitely better than the 'rita. I dont like the fake syrupy stuff. They didn't use fresh squeezed (key ingredient!) lime juice. Cheap tequila. No Grand Marnier floater like a really good 'rita has. The mojitio was better, and it did have fresh mint, but it was only OK. I guess we should have gotten the bottle!

The Scene: lots of scantily clad early 20's pretty girls taking orders and bringing drinks. They have male runners bring the food. Lots of people, in their mid 20's to early 30's drinking. A LOT. Since most of these are friends and family and employee's I'm sure this was toned down. A DJ playing good music. A table full of good food and drink. Me likey!

I wish we would have gotten there a little sooner and wish I could have stayed a little later. It was cool. DJ playing music, tons and tons of people walking around drinking. On one hand I did feel a little old, on the other, if I didnt work that day and have to work the next, I'd probably be, no, I *would* be one of the tons of drunk people. Instead, I went to Embers and had a FANTASTIC time at the elite event. 

I wish I could say I'd come back here. But I wont. Why? It's crazy expensive. We didn't pay to get in, or for the 1 free drink we each got. BUT the high roller cool sh*t we got came with a ""bill"" but it was ""comped"". For ONE carafe of mojito, 1 ahi tuna salad, 1 side of fries and 1 order of fish taco's the bill came to $149.00! They was no table charge, and I dont think I saw a fruit platter charge, and we didn't pay to get in OR those drinks, so, this would have been, what, a $300+ day if we had truly paid for each and every thing. Getting all that stuff was great, I loved it, and I'm thankful for it. I just would not spend my own money on that. If you have tons and tons of cash to spend on something like this, then you'd probably love it.",3

Ray, from Aztec Decks was recommended to us from our pool repair company and they worked hand in hand to bring our 1970's pool back to life.  His estimates were very reasonable and his attention to detail even better.  We had a chip in the concrete, without asking any questions (could've been there before) he just repaired it, moved our existing pool equipment and took the initiative to paint the plastic piping to protect from UV rays and labeled each pipe to its function.  Communicated with me throughout the process what his schedule was and when he would be able to complete tasks.  He was very patient, thoroughly explaining how he was going to lay out the work and would ""troubleshoot"" little challenges that seemingly always pop up.  His crew was polite and respectful of our property. Ask to see his portfolio of previous jobs, he has done some beautiful work on high end homes.

Proper procedure (I would think) is to go up to the customer and reiterate what you've said a different way. For example instead of saying ""it's to early to let people in the movie, the prior showing is still running"" maybe say something like ""its too early to let anyone in to the ENTIRE MOVIE THEATER and because of fire code safety we will need you to wait outside"". That way we don't assume that we can walk in and wait in the theater itself and you don't assume that my fiancé or myself will be able to determine your max occupancy for fire code safety.",1

k7fCLzP4-PrXSgzd5ruHdA,"I stayed at New York - New York and went to a trade show at the convention center.  It was 100 degrees out and the monorail was nicer than walking and cheaper than a taxi.  But if you're staying anywhere near the MGM, NY-NY, Excalibur, etc., you have to wander through the maze that is the MGM Grand to get to the monorail station.  And when you get to the convention center, it's still a hike to the convention center's north halls.  I like the monorail, but I wish they had made it a little more convenient.  And if you're trying to get down to Mandalay Bay or Luxor, you're out of luck because the MGM is as far south as it goes.

And just to say, we only came here because it was 3pm and The Local was not open until 5pm.

From the moment we stepped in I could tell the waitress was unhappy with her miserable life, or something. She kept texting on her phone and not paying attention to us even being there... (It was not busy, maybe our table and 3 others) When she FINALLY got up off her butt to come serve us, her arms were crossed in a very closed off and unfriendly manner, as she asked what she could get us. My friend asked for a drink menu in which case the waitress said ""we don't have one"" and looked away from her.. Not even mentioning what she had on tap, what she could get us instead... she just closed off the conversation completely. When we finally ordered, (it was like pulling teeth to get her to tell us what was on tap...) I had the burger which wasn't so terrible. But my friend had a cajun wrap which was absolutely disgusting. There was too much seasoning. It was like biting into a giant grain of salt. By this point I noticed my friend wasn't eating. I tried to get the waitress' attention but she was in her own little world.  She had only come back once to refill my friends boyfriends drink and left mine and my friends drinks empty for an hour, without the mention of a refill... and without her coming over to take my friends complaint to fix her food. She was too busy texting.

Needless to say after an hour of waiting... We put our plates and my friends unfinished plate of food on the bar for her to take away (When she was ready of course) And went to grab beers somewhere else.

Needless to say we did NOT tip and we will NOT be back.

T8Ez7yyUL_UAKDNZ45DaKA,"I absolutely love the Bellagio Conservatory. I visit 3 or 4 times a year when they change the display. You can check out the website for their schedule. I never go on the first day anymore because one time I showed up and they were still putting it together. 

Each display is created with all flowers. For example, at Christmas they had polar bears and they were made with mainly white flowers. (The whole body) It's amazing! In addition to the flowers, which are the main part of every display, they also have props. Recently, they had a mermaid display around September I think and in addition to flower mermaids, they had huge rocks, water, etc. 

Just a heads up, this display gets very busy. There's usually a flow to the traffic and you kind of have to wait in line to take pictures. I usually go in the evening, so maybe I'm always going at the busiest time.",5

HrYfgj7-ElQlAzY4pbM2yg,"I get giddy even as I begin this review! I had heard about Khao San Road for ages - but had been putting off trying this place due to the horror stories I had heard about long wait times and terrible service. 

With that being said, I managed my own expectations and decided to take the leap - and boy am I glad I did! I've been there a few times since, and here's what I think: 

- Wait time strategy: So yes, the place is often packed - so rather than attempt to wait hours in line, I've now opted to order my meals for take out. This way, I can walk right in, order (squeeze a few neighborhood errands in) and by the time I'm back, my food is ready to go!

- Service & Seating: Nothing amazing, but with that being said, I've always been greeted pleasantly and have not had a bad experience yet. I can see how waiting and being squeezed in could cause some irritation to waiting patrons. The seating set up often required sharing tables. Meh, I'll take mine to go... 

So, now to the food... one word: unbelievable. I can't actually imagine going anywhere else for my Thai food offering. I've been spoiled! I can't go back! 

1) Pad Thai - chicken with medium spiciness hits the spot. Their chef's special is the way to go!

2) Both red and green curries are additive and creamy. 

3) Squash fritters are unique and delightfully crispy/fried! A must try!

4) My absolute favorite - Khao Soi. Its messy, creamy, sweet, spicy and just the perfect bowl of goodness. Hands down a favourite go-to during a busy week when you need some good ol'comfort. 

The food is so good here, I can look past any possible deficiencies in set up, service and seating. Trust me, you'll agree.",5

I walked into this store and fell. Hard. I was that hearts-in-eyes emoji when I saw the fresh seafood counter with beautiful scallops. I turned into kissy-face emoji when I filled up my growler with delicious Arizona beers. Deep bowing emoji when I was eating my freshly scooped mint chocolate chip gelato on a hot summer day. Shut up, no I'm not overselling this.

Organic, yeah they have that. Gluten free, sure whatever. All-natural, okay fine. But this place to me is convenience and community and quality and a slice of heaven.

If I had the money, I'd eat here every day. Seriously. 

A favorite of mine is the medium rare buffalo burger with grilled veggies and a half avocado. My toddler enjoyed the yummy cheeseburger sliders with sweet potato tater tots. Also great is the orange chicken with rice, the burrito with a spinach tortilla (they have more options than Chipotle), all sorts of sandwiches with fresh ingredients and really yummy spreads, and of course the margherita pizza straight from their brick oven (which you can order whole pizzas for ten bucks on Thursdays, if you were wondering). There are some great fresh options at the buffet too. 

Once you get your food, pay at the Northside bar and order yourself a glass of wine or beer and take a seat at a table. We like to pull up a high chair from under the water dispenser for our son, and we're all set for some Lululemon-wearing people watching!

The store clerks are really helpful; they greet you as you walk in. They must work on commission, because when I checked out, I was asked if anyone had been helping me. Um, there were only two people working, so if it wasn't her, it had to be the other one!

Unfortunately, that peppermint is only available at Christmas time, when they have it in their liquid soaps, too. I suspected that, since the label is Christmas-themed. But I did manage to find a couple of scents that didn't make me want to puke, so I bought 5 bottles, to take advantage of the ""low"" 5 for $6 price. That should last until the Xmas shopping season starts - in August?",4
oI3L5ETPjk3p0j1P9rLjxg,"This is a review that is mainly based on the mini donuts.  I grew up feasting on Tiny Tom Donuts at the CNE with my family, so freshly made and sugar coated mini donuts hold a nostalgic part in my mind space.  Unfortunately, I am a commuter, so I don't have easy access to the Tiny Tom Donuts shop in Markham. That's where Little Nicky's Coffee comes into the picture.  It is located in an inconspicuous corner of a building near Scotiabank Theatre. The only noticeable signage is the directional banner that is painted on one side of the building, so you won't miss it.  Even the interior design isn't too glamourous, but it definitely has its own charm with its dim lighting, murky green walls, 50's diner inspired decorative pieces and so forth.  Now, onto the rock star of the show: the mini donuts. They are extremely affordable at $2.75 for half a dozen and $4 for a dozen (tax inclusive).  They taste similar to Tiny Tom Donuts and, because they are freshly made per order, you will get fluffy, soft, and subtly sweet mouthfuls after a five minute wait.  Don't wait too long to bite into them because they lose their softness after 15 minutes or so. Trust me, they are truly at their best when they are eaten fresh from the fryer.",4

sWe217MtRWcK_rm9-QMR_g,"My Wife and I have been taking our cars here for a couple of years now, 2006 Honda CRV & 2008 Toyota Prius. Since they are newer cars and reliable models/brands, one wouldn't expect to have to do any major repairs, which has been the case. However, when waiting in the lobby on for our oil changes and such, I've overheard the techs dealing with customers that have major repairs and they are very detailed in their explanations, and by and large, they do not seem like ripoff artists AT ALL, which is usually the case with these auto fix-it places, Even with just a simple oil change they inspect the vehicle thoroughly, even telling this lady last time I was there that her license plate light was out (and it'd be $8.00 to fix). Clean, friendly, thorough place, and they'll even give you a ride home or to work if the repair takes a while.",5

It's too hot to bring my furbaby to outdoor parks, but I know he loves to play so this is a perfect and affordable solution! The staff is super nice and they will play and interact with your dog. I really like that they do behavior assessments because I've had too many encounters with dogs at the traditional dog park that shouldn't be there. I will probably continue to take him to the indoor dog park even when it cools down for this reason. The fact they serve wine and beer is a fun bonus! They keep the area very clean, if a dog has an accident or gets mopped up immediately. There are also grass pads if you're baby needs to use the bathroom.",5

It lacked its normal pumpkin robust flavor. 
Otherwise as always Four Peaks has exceeded our expectations again, thank you!!

iYhc7BpSQS8bcC7xdCl-Tg,"HIGHER PRICES & SMALLER SHRIMP!

We have had many 5 star meals here but some of the recent changes don't bode well for the future. Recently they raised their menu prices 25 to 50% and cut portions as well the quality of some ingredients. Pretty ballsy to do both at the same time and I am not sure it will accomplish what they want; which is to make a profit. I can no longer recommend El Dorado Cantina at full menu prices, however some of the discounts and promotions are still good.

NOW THE FOOD! It is outstanding, before the changes I would have said the best Mexican food in Las Vegas. The Shrimp Taquitos were fabulous with the larger shrimp and still good with the smaller ones. The shrimp and steak Fajitas are very good but they have cut the portion and raised the price from $20 to $28; now you get less steak and 3 small shrimp instead of 4 large ones.
 
I'm going to go ahead and recommend the following dishes even though I have not tried them since they started making changes: Cochinita & Carnitas in tacos or the dinner, Carne Asada,  Fried Huachinango (sadly now off the menu), Cilantro Garlic Shrimp, Tropical Mahi, Huevos Divorciados, Queso Fundido, Gorditas with pulled chicken, Tres Leches Cake, and the sublime Chile Relleno.

I love Cheese Enchiladas but they really SUCK here. Do not order them they are not good. The cheese is not melted properly, the sauce is OK but there isn't enough of it to make them moist. The Shrimp Cocktail used to be great but is now way too sweet. Not quite the restaurant that it was or could have been but probably worth a try with a discount.",4
eaOKswxBoi-z2asjnW0h3g,"This place is like a pinball museum with so many different pinball machines, but you can actually play the games here. I am so glad that I finally came here. My husband and I came here on a Sunday night and it wasn't crowded. I immediately exchanged a $5 for quarters right when I got there and we played a ton of fun games for 2 hours (not bad for $5 of entertainment for 2). The games are from $0.25 to $0.75 per play. The older games are $0.25 and are actually really amazing to see how they still run and how they work.

Not only are there pinball games, but there are also old school joystick arcade games here as well and other old relic style games. I love that there are index cards on most of the games here so you can read a little bit of the fascinating history over how the pinball hall of fame acquired the games in their possession. Some of the stories are pretty interesting. 

Some of the games at this place are just really cool. I have never played some of these games or seen some of the type of games before at other arcades or the one arcade that reminds me of the place on Fisherman's Wharf (http://www.yelp.com/biz/mus%C3%A9e-m%C3%A9canique-san-francisco-4). 

Will come back here the next time I am here (by the way, this place is pretty close by the strip and is located in a plaza with a camera shop).",5

zXLZWB6i1i3XnogDAK-G3w,"This is an excellent oyster restaurant - it is NOT a good sushi restaurant.  If you love oysters, you will be in heaven at this spot.  This is a must try spot for oysters.

The restaurant is nicely decorated and I found the service to be pleasant and very well informed.  Hopefully, if you dine here you will have a love of oysters because they are fresh, beautiful, large and a very good deal.  I had a mix of the $1 and $2 oysters with the wasabi cocktail sauce, rosemary mignonette and the ponzu salsa.  All the sauces work very well with the oysters, but the ponzu salsa was tangy and fresh and it was the absolute best.  To be able to have a dozen or two of excellent oysters and not break the bank is the number one reason to visit this restaurant.

I was very let down by the nigiri and crudo at this restaurant.  We ordered the nigiri sampler for $15.  The fish on the nigiri was dried out and sliced too thin for the price.  The rice in the nigiri was flavorless.  So many other AYCE sushi joints in this town would shame Other Mama when it comes to nigiri.  We also tried the amberjack crudo.  The flavor of the salsa on the crudo was amazing, but once again the tiny and thin slices of fish were not acceptable for the price ($13).

I wasn't terribly impressed by the cocktails, and I tried two of them.  They were small and the fascinating descriptions of the ingredients just didn't deliver a satisfying drink.  They do have an excellent draft beer selection and I found that tasted better with the oysters.  The next time I go I am just going to order oysters and beer and it will be a 5 star experience.  I recommend everyone else do the same.",4

Considering the surrounding restaurants are mostly fast food/take out places, this is a cool change in pace. I have only had Shabu-shabu style food a handful of times but this was my first. I am pescatarian so I stuck with fish and veggies in my hot pot. Overall, there is a good variety of sauces and meats to choose from and the novelty of a shabu place is always fun. Each person gets their own hot pot which is nice (good for meat eaters vs non). However, it is fairly pricey especially since this is a college neighborhood (our meals ended up ~$30 per person).",4

The Crab Angel appetizers were delicious and the orange sauce was mild, which complimented the appetizer nicely.  The Eggplant Thai with chicken was great with perfectly cooked vegetables, tender chicken, and the right amount of spices.  The Panang Curry was also great.
The portions are generous and prices reasonable.  For 2 dinners with the appetizer we spent $31 and took leftovers home.",5
HsvVQAZOYcLQ_OpLXVlEzg,"This is certainly the coolest Dim Sum restaurant I ever stepped into. Although it is clearly Chinese themed, It also feels a little Medieval. 

First the GOOD:

- Not overcrowded like most dim sum places. And not as loud, tables are a good distance apart.

- Table settings well above average.

- Service was generally good but a little cold at times.

- Like the double sided tea cups - not too hot to hold. Fancy tea pots remain heated thanks to a candle underneath. 

- Beautiful spotless washrooms

We ordered way too much food but some high level thoughts...

- 3 color shrimp & scallop dumpling - Pretty to look at, average taste.

- Shrimp and vegetable dumpling - Pretty to look at, average taste  

- Mixed mushroom dumpling - good

- Chicken & chive dumplings - the standout of the meal

- Squid tentacles - kind of oily

- Stir fried rice noodle with shrimps and vegetables - good

- Steamed beef ball - no thanks

- Sesame balls with custard - good

- Lotus leaf sticky rice - good

And the Not so GOOD:

- It is pricier vs. most of the competition. 

I enjoyed my experience at Dragon Legend and appreciated the attention to detail with respect to decor. Not my favourite dim sum in Markham but worth a visit every now and then.

The Greek Tycoon is a very snazzy restaurant with low, ambient lighting (except for the occasional burst of flame and sudden heat with 'Opa!' being recited as the saganaki was being lit). 

Nevertheless, I always order the steak and potatoes even to this day because the steak is juicy and I love Greek style potatoes. The salad is pretty good and they give you fresh baked bread while waiting for your meal.

1. The shop itself is adorable. I love the painting they've done and it's all very clean and minimalist while still being charming. 

2. The service was very warm and friendly. Not the typical vegan hipster elitist type you find often in DoPho. 

3. I got my coworker a red velvet cupcake, and because they're my favorite I got myself one too, just to try out. Because they're vegan I didn't expect to be wowed at all.. I was so wrong! The cupcake was delicious. Very flavorful and pretty true to form for a traditional red velvet cupcake. My coworker hasn't had hers yet, but I'm sure she'll love it. 

All in all this place gets 5 stars because of the adorable atmosphere, friendly service, and most importantly; they've mastered a vegan cupcake that tastes delicious instead of disgusting!

I know it's just a burger but something about their burgers have me hooked. Great customer service, restaurant is always clean and food is always delivered fast, unless the restaurant is busy, then it takes a little time but that o.k.

I get the double, fries and a diet coke. My wife loves the animal fries, it's not on the menu so ask for it if your taste buds happy.

Good prices, good go to food on busy days.",5

tLjQ5yqMJIxkAehRSXpyHg,"I was pretty stoked to try this place, but it was a huge disappointment. We were greeted right away and sat outside. We waited about 5 minutes before the hostess brought us waters and said the server would be there shortly. It was another 5 minutes before our server got there and said ""sorry about the wait. Do you guys want anything besides water?"" We asked what beers they had on tap since the cocktail menu only had overpriced mixed drinks listed. He named off a few beers including a ""sriracha ale."" My boyfriend was intrigued because he likes to try weird beers so he asked what it was. The server told us it was a local brew, so he got it. He liked it, but couldn't figure out why it was called sriracha ale, so I googled it. It's actually Sorachi Ale and it's from Brooklyn. He said Sriracha and we said Sriracha multiple times. The dude clearly had no idea. 

We ordered salads and about 5 minutes later ordered a fish n chips. The salads came at the same time as the meal another 15 or so minutes later. I ordered a salad before my food so if get it before. He didn't even acknowledge that the salads took 20 minutes and that they came out with our food. The fish was pretty good, but the fries looked like something you get in the middle school cafeteria. They were clearly frozen crinkle cut fries. 

The beer was $10 for a 16 oz, which is insane. You can get a 22oz on the strip for cheaper. And like I said, the cocktails were way over priced. 

The atmosphere was super weird. I don't even know how to describe it besides saying I was happy I was outside watching football on a projector with low sound because the ambiance inside had an eery feel. Not to mention the strange outfits the staff wore.... 

Unfortunately I don't think I'll go back to The Mixx.",2
9eJqngjuyTJUR2ZUit1sDQ,"The most important to remember about Grand Lux Cafe is that it's open 24/7! So for all you early morning-ers, looking for food after the club or after a great long night of gambling, this is definitely the spot for you! 

Grand Lux Cafe is The Cheesecake Factory's Little Brother. Same owners, so they have very similar concepts, menu items and drinky drinks. As soon as you walk in, it feels like you're walking into The Cheesecake Factory. Best thing about our visit, is that we're were seated within 5 minutes of just walking in. From the outside, it looks like a small seating area but once you walk into the back, the restaurant is huge! This is a great place for large dinner parties or that intimate date night. 

My hubby and I have dined here before and have enjoyed it every time. For this past visit, here are the items we tried:

*Peach Bellini- blended and not too sweet. Great breakfast drink. 

*Strawberry Sangria- this is too sweet; I wouldn't order this again.

*Sunday Night Pasta- pieces of short rib beef, with ground beef, mushrooms and onions in a thick red sauce over a bed of thin spaghetti noodles. Not your ordinary spaghetti. The sauce was a bit salty so I added Alfredo sauce to balance it out. After adding the Alfredo sauce and drops of Tabasco, this dish was pretty good. 

*Chicken Royale- this dish comes with string beans, mashed potatoes and a ton of breaded pieces of boneless chicken. Peep the pictures, this dish was yummy! 

Fast service for decent priced food. We'll always consider Grand Lux Cafe for our dining needs.",4
c2M0LkxYUqGGoVL0VNzZNg,"I'm surprised by the reviews I've read for Thai Island, because I was impressed with it. It's fast food Thai and it's quite yummy with fresh ingredients and the service is fast. I don't know what else more you could ask of a take away Thai business? The reviews for the various locations all say ""I could get way better for the same price at a sit-down restaurant."" - but you're not at a sit down restaurant. You're eating take-away, so judge the place by take-away standards. The food gets prepped quite differently in order to be ready in 5 minutes or less. It's a different ballgame. 

With that said I enjoy the food here. Yes, it's not sit-down restaurant quality, but I don't go to McDonalds and get angry it's not Burger Shack.",4
QbEmUwsBlSrbGQWO7yILsw,"This place is the most unprofessional establishment in AZ, i witnessed a security guard named DARELL AKA definitely not a real man, a piece of shit is what he is! Choked out a tiny female that was unarmed.  Because he was pissy with her attitude! He used his size and strength to get physical with her. Needless to say this girl was like 110lbs.  A manager never even came to see what was going on with this bar room brawl between this one female and the staff, but because the security guard and his friends were around it turned into complete chaos.  LET ME TELL YOU THIS, PLEASE DO NOT ENCOURAGE THIS ESTABLISHMENT!!

tYRV9v8huJqjgWmHYF_VvA,"I thought I'd had a good cut for curly hair until I saw Keina this past Friday.  I didn't know it was possible to make sure a huge difference to how my hair looks and feels, without going to a drastically different style. (like long to short)

Keina kept my hair long, but cut off enough to allow it to be healthy and then worked some kind of magic with the front and top that took me from long curtain of heavy hair (with a flat top) to happy bouncy non-flattop hair.  She also suggested some products, explaining why, and how to use them every step of the way.  The products weren't cheap, but man, I could feel the difference.  Generally I'm a drugstore shopper on that front, but now I'm a convert.  I've even reproduced her amazing styling successfully myself using those same products and the techniques she described.  I have to say, the products were more expensive at the start, but you only need to use a tiny bit of them (even in my  mass of hair) so i think things might even out a bit in the long run.

Anyhow - if you have curly hair, that you wear curly, and you like for your hair to feel soft and look not frizzy, but actually nice and sproingy and curly - then go here!",5
ZZVE5WG5Kau8OPe2NW1F7w,"Cafe Monarch is a fine Dinning Restaurant located in Old Town Scottsdale. This is a multi award winning restaurant. Voted best romantic restaurant in the country by Yelp....Voted Number ONE Restaurant of Scottsdale by Tripadvisor out of 956 restaurants (in 2018). This is a reservation ONLY restaurant. Walk ins are not accepted. They offer fixed priced four course dinners that run at 2018 prices of between $80-$140.00. Wine pairing runs around $95.00 a person or you can purchase cocktails or bottles of wine. We thought the bottle pricing was a reasonable mark up. They only marked up the pricing less than half on our bottle and many places usually mark up the prices much more than that. The menu changes every other week so it's unlikely you will be able to try what I tried.

To cut a long story short.........

Atmosphere is amazing.....if weather is nice you might want to request patio dining in your reservation.

Service was very professional and servers are trained in sommelier training.

The food is mostly very detailed and high quality. 

If they offer the Squash Blossom Relleno - GET IT......It was one of the very best things I tried anywhere. Very Complex and full of textures...so flavorful....wish I could eat a plate of them.

Another favorite of the evening was the Yellow Fin Tuna Crudo.......Really Great......full of flavors.

The dirt......Chairs inside are not so comfortable. Springs are broken and chairs are in need of repair or replacement.

More DIRT.....Not a fan of the Bananas Foster bread pudding....so much so I might never order dessert here again...Very dense, not sweet, unripe bananas.....

A most lovely dinner....not perfect....but for the most part if I ignore the dessert ...then very good -  to -  exceptional.

I was so stressed when I showed up with the tow truck but Carl made me feel at ease. He was completely honest and upfront about the job. He never overpromised, and he couldn't have been fairer on the price. The technician who worked on my car put a lot of energy into making sure everything was done right. He even took time to explain everything he'd done to the car. It's not easy to find people in this town who take the extra time to make the customer happy and to do the job right.

The staff is very genuine and friendly and the facility is spacious and well equipped for the dance and fitness classes.  Prices are reasonable for dance/ fitness in the Phoenix area and I hope I can take in a Yoga or Zumba class myself one day soon!

6wfmtaRiiJm8Ds-9ChFV0g,This sushi bar is delicious !!,5
SL1V6liH8YcsK4Ok1gFJ_A,"So the truth is...I am super picky about where I go out to eat.  Don't get me wrong, I am not a picky eater, I just feel that when I spend money on food, I want to enjoy all aspects of eating out.  Having said this, I am a huge fan of Big Catch! 

I have eaten here at least 20 times in the last 1.5 years, and I will continue to go back.  I am a celiac and I find it difficult to find restaurants that understand how important it is for me to have gluten free, cross-contamination free food, and Big Catch really does understand this.  They have plenty of GF options available, and they will also modify menu items to make them gluten free, they will also prepare the food separately. Yay!!!  I have not had any issues there the entire time I've been a customer which decreases my ""celiac anxiety"" by 95% (I must retain 5% for personal expediency ;)

I like that Big Catch is located in the Market on Macleod.  I don't normally visit during market hours, but afterwards when the market stalls are closed, but Big Catch is still open.  At those times the tables of the indoor courtyard are only occupied by other customers of Big Catch.  I find the environment cozy and unpretentious.  In warm weather, you can also eat outside on the picnic tables.  I wouldn't exactly call the food fast food, as each order is made to order, and larger orders can take some time.

Down to the most important part of the review, food and service.  I have not found a sushi place in Calgary that rivals Big Catch.  The food is expertly prepared and presented, and is always of high quality, with fresh ingredients and actually ripe veggies (avocados etc).  I have enjoyed every roll I've tried, the sashimi is excellent and I actually crave the miso soup.  I find the food to be reliable and consistent in quality, the service is the same.  Always excellent service, very friendly and accommodating. Shout out to Non, who has made every visit a true pleasure, thank you :)

The prices are fair, depending on how hungry you are $75 can feed 4 people (regular hunger) or 2 people (Big Bear hunger!!!) with soup and drinks and tip included.

Food to try:
Rolls: Aburi Salmon, Zesty Avalanche, Meteor Rain, Tropic Rush, 911, Mount Alaska
Combo: Spicy Catch Combo
Soup: Orignal or Spicy Miso
Beverages: Green tea and this really funky soda that has a neat bottle with a glass ball that carbonates the drink... tastes like cream soda.

I would recommend Big Catch to anyone for dine in or takeout, and have enjoyed meals there with my partner, our friends and family.  

I feel like I'm gushing now, so I'll end the review!",5
H5BjE4PgwelJiKbjSBn6Sw,"I was disappointed. I had really high hopes for this food truck. I had a cheesesteak with whiz, mushroom, and onions. The whole sandwich tasted overwhelmingly of onions. The positive is that the sandwich was stuffed with the meat mixture. The negative is I didn't like it enough to finish it. It was edible, but did not make me want to find them again.",3
Kfh4Iqc4OrCydhO6AIldBQ,"This isn't a place I'd recommend or go to ever again. I picked it for the convenience and the reviews weren't too bad. I get manicures and pedicures done regularly and Yeti's does not know what it's doing.

I went with a girl friend for her birthday. We got a pedicure first. Her girl was so rough on her feet and even cut her. My lady, I think she was the owner, was so rushed she forgot to put top coat on (and didn't realize this until later). I was really looking forward to getting my feet softened... My feet weren't really buffed and are still rough. After the rushed pedicure, I got hurried over to get my Shallac nails. It was another girl doing it. She had so much attitude, as did my friend's girl. They didn't soak our nails to soften the cuticles to remove... They did it dry! I'm not even sure how clean the tools are! You can tell how inexperienced these ladies are. They're so rough. They didn't even have room for me to dry my toes. My friend went to the fan and it barely worked. She said the other customers weren't impressed either.

This place lacks in service and skills! I wouldn't go here ever again and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. They charge what other places who have experienced ladies charge. They don't even seem like they care or want to be better. This place is a no-go. That bad!",1

It is a clean and open space with plenty of choice tables and bar seating!  Over 100 tv's!!!  Now that's what I call a Sports Bar!

My first time in and within five minutes I met TJ, Beth, Renee' & David and they were all friendly and welcoming.

Everyone of them made sure I was in front of the TV I needed to be in front of with sound!  Yay!

They have at least 3 separate areas for Pittsburgh fans, Philadelphia Fans and I think Miami, too.  

I think they have a fairly nice patio also with plenty of tv's.  That's where the smokers are, so I didn't make it out there.  They also have free wi-fi, which is great!

The food was good, too.  Crinkle Cut French fries came with my Rueben Wrap.  The wrap was on the small side, but the flavor was big!  The Popcorn Shrimp were well-cooked and came to the table without being gooey with residual oil.  They were yummy.

They have drink & food special every day.  They also do trivia, karaoke and other fun things throughout the week.  I don't think it was very expensive, maybe a little high for a small sandwich, but not unusually priced for Charlotte.  I hope I can get back in for the CrabLeg Special - that's an awesome deal.

I'm definitely glad to have met this great group of people in a great place to go and hang for some sports!",4

TsJnx-_2Q3STJfvx5E-YvA,"As far as BBQ goes, this place is pretty good.  Had to try Thee Pitts Again after driving by and seeing this place all lite up like a 60's Dinner.  When you walk in you know your in good hands after seeing all of the trophies they have won over the years.

We started with their fried cheese squares and fried pickles.  Both were very good. My friend had never had a fried pickle so it was truly a treat for him. I had a pulled pork sandwich with the slaw on top. It was very good, pork was tender and dried out.  Their fries were ok.  

My friend had their ribs which to our surprise had a lot of fat on them.  If they smoked their ribs for hours you would think there would be little fat if any left in them providing they were trimmed before cooking.  We told our server and she stated ""no one ever complains about our ribs""... 

Based on their pulled pork and apps we will visit them again but we won't get ribs. Maybe try their brisket instead.",3
GMXy8MnjllYg6pj7r52UPw,"Was looking forward to trying this place out but left disappointed. I did the hot stone bowl for $12 which was dine in only. It's 99 cents extra if you want a fried egg added. Normally, I eat bibimbap where they crack the raw egg and mix it but here it's already fried. You pick out the ingredients which I thought was a cool concept and then they have someone warm it up for you. The bowl was probably medium size. Smaller size than the traditional bibimbap bowls. My food came out and it was average. I would say I wish there was more flavor or something to bring it more together. I think it's a bit pricey for the stone bowl because I can go to a traditional Korean place and get it for $10-11 where they don't charge you extra for an egg. I will say that my experience was okay/average. I like the concept but the flavor and taste was lacking for me. I rather go to a Korean restaurant and order bibimbap because it taste better for me. At least I got to experience it.",3
gwDWQUrqGqb31AunBwWteA,"It's not easy finding good gluten-free dining in Phoenix. Since the closing of Mandala (about a week after I discovered it, natch) I'd come to the conclusion that I'd just have to deal with the few GF-friendly chain restaurants with their limited options. Then, I found Chakra 4.

Not only do I love the food - try the Nutty Rawvacado Dip - but the ambience is casual and relaxing. Perfect for a long weekend lunch. I love their selection of hot and cold soups, and they even offer gluten-free bread (locally baked at Gluten-Free Creations). 

They are a bit on the pricy side for what amounts to soup, salads, and sandwiches, even if you're not ordering gluten free, but knowing exactly what's in the food I'm eating is important to me and well worth the extra few bucks.",4

VH-4kgEH0C8dU0UWTNFgHw,"First, let me say that I am a huge fan of Dr. Andrew Weil.  He is an advocate of eating whole, natural and organic foods whenever possible.  He doesn't have a 'diet' book, but he does advocate for eating in a way that our bodies our truly nourished.  I was soo excited to find out about True Food Kitchen.

I found the decor to be light and festive.  My dad found the colors reminded him of the 70's. lol. Our waiter was really nice and took the time to explain all of the teas available to my mom. He suggested we try the hummus, and since I'm a sucker for chickpeas, we ordered it.
I'm totally going to start making my hummus with some jalepeno!  It was great, but a tad spicy for some.  We loved it.

I had the steak tacos with adzuki beans.  The beans were quite spicy and I only ate half, but they were delicious. The tacos were great and I could tell the meat was ""organic"" (duh, of course meat is organic people!) because of the distinct taste of meat not raised with added hormones.  

One plus about this place is that people who have allergies to certain food products are absolutely able to eat here.  There are plenty of vegan, vegetarian, and dairy-free items on the menu. I will definitely be back.  My only problem is that I found it to be a bit expensive, but then again, I'm cheap. lol.

BkGqtM-imqao3SOaeYMTsw,"Alaska was my preferred carrier on the west coast until I decided to make the jump to loyalty program for a much larger network. I always have liked Alaska's level of service, however, and if I'm flying somewhere that's more convenient for Alaska's routes, then it's my top pick. For PDX-LAS - my normal carrier requires a two-leg journey, which is stupid. So Alaska is my go-to. They have multiple non-stop flights per day, and at least some of the planes have been updated with the new power outlets at every seat. And of course gogo in flght wifi. 

While airline service across the board is a mere shadow of what it used to be, as far as the current standards go, Alaska still wins in my book... unless you put it up against Virgin, which has pretty rad service too. That said, the folks who work these flights are nice and friendly. As much as the seat sizes and baggage nonsense make it feel like cattle call in Economy, the crews on the ground and in the air don't contribute to it at all. And when flying to and from LAS, where it seems the majority of people don't listen or can't understand basic rules/etiquette, they offer a firm display of reminders that I wish all gate agents would. Like turning people away from boarding when they're trying to board ahead of their group. Or not letting people with rollers on in the group that's supposed to be boarding without rollers. My one main gripe with boarding is that they do offer earlier boarding to people who only have bags that will fit under the seat. Guess what? Those people still mostly put those bags in overhead. Frankly if they offered gate-check where I could get my bag at the gate on the other end, I'd be happy to send my roller below. But otherwise it's all out battle for those overheads. 

Aside from my main issue with their boarding processes, I dig the rest of the way they do things at Alaska. And I'll keep digging it... especially on this route.",4

The flavour of the seafood was well blend into this creamy soup and the amount of black pepper they've put in really kicked a notch. For the main course, I've ordered the Grilled California Cut New York Strip Steak with Rigatoni Marinara. The steak was a bit chewy even though I've asked for medium rare.

I have been to other dry cleaning stores where it looks like they didn't even clean the clothes and they just threw them on the hanger. Best dry cleaners make my clothes look brand new.

iOZrBKX9_IEsZ1XM96Is-Q,"I really like the Miller. It feels like such an adult place, quite different from its glory days as Brunswick House of North Toronto of the 1980s. The interior is comfortable and classy, with a lovely fireplace in the winter. The bar is cozy as well, and the bar is well stocked with single malts and higher end liquors. You can watch as they shuck oysters at the bar, perhaps even onto a plate for you.

The patio is one of the better ones I've ever been on. It doesn't look like much from the street, but it descends down several levels, as the Miller is basically a backsplit building with multiple floors leading to the parking lot. The patio feels less like a bar patio and more like a deck in a wealthier friend's backyard. The lighting could be better--some corners are nearly completely dark--but perhaps that's what some patrons are looking for.

I haven't tried much of the food (I mainly go for cocktails), but what food I've tried has been tasty, though not inexpensive. The service has mainly been good, but slower on the patio where it can take longer to get a drink and you might have to ask more than once for water.

I've noticed that the clientele is higher end as well. Many Mercedes and BMWs in the parking lot, and lots of white teeth and sweaters tied around the shoulders inside. I was there with some friends on a Saturday night watching the game and several single women of slightly older vintage lined the bar. They added to what is a fun environment, without threat of frat kids looking to get bombed.

A comfortable place, if a little off the beaten path in the heart of Hoggs Hollow.",4

Keep in mind that this isn't your fancy MGM, Wynn, Caesar Palace, Palazzo type of lobby. This hotel is more of a mellow hotel. They have a swimming pool that's open from 6am-3am but it's not big. Keep your room key on you at all time because for security/guest safety purposes, you'll need it in order to get to your floor and for access to the pool and gym. The walking distance from the strip is approximately 10-15 minutes! We stayed in room 1557, and it didn't have an amazing view but we could still see some view of the strip. They have free self parking and free wifi. We went to Las Vegas in the first week of July and the temperature fluctuated from 109-115. The air conditioner works so that'll be great during the summer! They offer AAA discounts if you are a AAA member.",5
mcrWm2aJ4cnPcwt22B8E_g,"I stayed at this hotel for business last night and I was impressed. 

First, the Good:
1. Pillows: Normally, I'm skeptical of motel pillows because I've had so many that were so flat and unsupportive, that I usually bring my own, but the ones I had in my room were lumpy, but still had some good support left in them and I slept a solid 5 hours. 

2. The Bed: A little on the soft side for my preference, but still very supportive and didn't require me to wake up and make a significant effort to roll over in the middle of the night. 

3. The Room: I had a King room just for myself and it was very spacious. It included a desk with a nice office chair, a large TV whose angle could be adjusted to view from the bed or from the chair with foot rest easily. There were plenty of plug-ins to charge my cell phone from and the clock radio actually had an accurate time on it. 

4. The Amenities: I had a fridge, a coffee maker, and a safe in my room. I appreciated having the first 2 because I brought my own food for dinner and breakfast so I needed to keep it cold and I like having coffee in the morning. The safe I could have done without. I had 4 packages of coffee (3 caff and 1 decaf), several styrofoam cups, and various lotion or shampoos. There was also an iron and ironing board in my room, which is a plus for business travelers.   

5. The Door: I like that if I pushed it back far enough it stayed open and did not slam shut on me or my luggage as I tried to enter my room for the first time. 

6. A Balcony: I didn't use it, but it was nice to know it as there. 

Things I didn't like:
1. No Breakfast Service/Eating in The Rodehouse restaurant. There's nothing else around there and the RodeHouse restaurant is over-priced and not healthy for those trying to watch they eat. Fortunately, I had brought my own food for both meals I was at the hotel. 

2. The Proximity to the airport: I'm glad the airport closes its runways at night because I heard planes taking off ~45 seconds up until 10pm and they were so close, I could tell what kind of airline they were just from the lights on the planes, otherwise, no noise over night or it was very intermittent. 

3. Lack of an Elevator: Now, the hotel only has 2 floors, but if you're a hotel near the airport, it would be safe to assume that many of your clientele would be traveling with a large, heavy suitcase in tow and having to haul it up a flight of steep stairs is not very practical or convenient. 

Overall, I would recommend this place for business or if you need a very convenient place to stay in Phoenix before a morning flight out of Sky Harbor Airport.",4

k95w8yk5fPnNkuZP9ccIlA,"I was beyond satisfied with my visit to AK Auto. I showed up middle of the day with no appointment. I told them I didn't know what the heck was wrong but I was hoping to at least have someone take a look at my car to let me know what needed to be repaired and get an estimate. They said give them about an hour and they would call with their findings. They called within 45 minutes to let me know what needed to be done. To my surprise they said they were even able to get ALL the work done same day. My favorite part of the whole experience is it didn't feel like they were trying to upsell me. They kept me updated through the whole process and informed me of my options, but didn't pressure me one way or the other. To top it off, the owner Arlo double checked all the work before sending us on our way. Overall, best experience I've had at an auto shop. I gimped my car in at about 12:30 and it was back to me by 6:00. This included them needed two parts delivered and the fact that they squeezed me into their full schedule. I will be going to them for any future needs!",5

I opted for the veggie hoagie sans cheese. It was average, I liked that it was served on garlic bread and the Italian dressing was great. Perfectly toasted. I feel like it was a bit pricey for a ten inch veggie hoagie and a soda at 9.75 but it was late and I was hungry. It's a small joint, not the nicest decor, but it's just your average typical pizza place. Doubt I'll be back.",3

Super clean place. Very courteous cashier and server.

We also ordered the chicken and salmon skewers with salad, both seasoned perfectly , both delicious!
Pita bread is served warm and both the cucumber and regular salads were very good.

PqRNDAi3Zdj1_zEsnYmlUA,"I visited Ozu for their soft opening today for dinner. Me and two friends got there around 5:15PM and had to wait until 6:30PM for a table. We ordered a Karaage to share and then each got the Tonkotsu Black Ramen (a naming scheme taken from Shin Ramyun-- Black, maybe?) At some point, the woman in charge gave us free edamame to apologize for the wait, which was really nice of her. Also, she regularly checked in to make sure we were well served.

From there, we then waited another TWO HOURS for our ramen. The food was really tasty and worth the price but the wait was too long.

I know that a friend of mine who waited a similar amount of time got some sort of percentage off of his meal but this option wasn't available for me and my friends, which was disappointing. If I have a good experience at this place next time in terms of wait or if they offered us the same discount to accommodate our super long wait time, I'll probably update my review to be 5 stars.

Pros:
-Great food, the broth is authentic and tasty
-Good sized portions
-Great noodles (not authentic but they're still tasty)
-Really good Karaage (it's served with Kewpie spicy mayo but could really use a lemon. Also, there were a lot of fried dough pieces that didn't have any meat. I'd recommend getting rid of these because they're just kinda oily and detract from an otherwise really good appetizer.)
-Good variety inside the ramen
-Reasonable prices
-Beautiful decor inside, I really liked the exposed kitchen area (super authentic looking!)
-Really nice service (the lady helping us felt bad for the wait and gave us free edamame)
-The staff were really attentive and refilled our water regularly
-The menu selection seems really nice
-Really good for a soft opening
-Their take-out boxes are super sturdy and given the number of times I've had those soup containers melt/break on me, I can really appreciate that.
-High quality meat

Cons:
-Extremely long wait (we kept being told that our order was coming but we consistently saw tables seated after us get served first, this is why I took away one star for this place.)
-The seating area where you wait to be called up is kind of small and you basically had to wait outside or next door at Latea.
-The soft boiled egg was a little overcooked
-The spoon given with the ramen was a little dirty, kinda wish I said something about it but I didn't want to bother the waitress. I would recommend getting a new one if this happens to you. It's probably just a dishwashing mishap.
-The tables were a bit too close together in my opinion but this really wasn't a big deal.

All in all, I'm really happy with the food here even though there was a long wait. I can't wait for them to get into the swing of things because this place has a lot of potential and I'm happy to see a good ramen place other than Sakanaya on Green!",4
WlCVELfvDdJeig_pciN58Q,"I purchased over $15k in appliances, all from Spencer's. The upfront service was very good, particularly the sales person. The ""after the sale"" customer service was pathetic. I purchased 4 LG PRODUCTS including washer and dryer, refridgerator and dishwasher, all the upgraded models. The refrigerator is tipped back and uneven on the floor. When you open it, the shelves are tipped to the back and it is clear that there is a problem. Neither Spencer's or LG would do anything, even after the contractor sent pictures of the tipped refrigerator. 
My definition of good customer service is what happens after the sale and both of these companies failed. It is very frustrating, especially since this was a huge investment for my husband and I.  I would not recommend either business especially in light of the poor ""after the sale"" support.",2

Very unnecessary, I jumped when she did it, and she quit digging in there but the damage was done.  I have no idea why anyone would dig around someone's nails like that.

I did notate hair loss, to simplify my symptoms on paper. The front desk attendant diagnosed me with alopecia while I'm still in the waiting room with multiple patients who could hear our conversation. They told me my office visit would be $160. At this point I'm embarrassed. ""Well is there anything else you have,because hair loss just won't be covered"" I said no it's a little different I don't know if it's alopecia. Front desk's reply was ""Well there's different types."" And that was that. I could not believe we were having this conversation in the waiting room.

The bartender gave us a sob story about how he would have to pay for the drinks if he messed up, so we (in very poor judgment) agreed to pay for an extra drink to switch a tonic out for soda water. Then we asked for a glass of water and he gave us a bottle which we were charged for. I also asked what their vibe was and the bartender (who had been there for years) had absolutely no idea.

1) Fried Watermelon - we thought this was unique and wanted to try this.  I thought it would taste a lot better considering the price we pay for it. It just tasted fried with water (the watermelon wasn't very flavourful) 

2) Big Mac ""bao"" - I saw pictures of this while I was yelping about what to eat.  The pictures looked good so I wanted to try this. The bao was hot and fresh, but was not flavourful. I wasn't a big fan of the sauce Adobe it. 

3) Jellyfish Slaw - I really enjoyed this dish.  I thought it was very flavourful and the jellyfish was delicious.  I think this was one of their cheaper and bigger dishes. 

4) Crispy Octopus Taco - this came with two tacos. The octopus tasted really good. 

5) Miso Salt Cod Brandade - I ordered this thinking it was soup with the Chinese donut.   I realized that you dip the Chinese donut in the brandade.  The brandade didn't taste good alone. The cod was very minimal but when I had a bite of it, it was really good.  At the end, we finished all the Chinese donut, with a lot of leftover brandade. 

6) Char Siu Pork Loin - I really enjoyed this dish too. The char siu was really good- so flavourful and juicy. I think it came with 3 steamed buns but we ordered an additional one. 

7) Ponzu Beef Carpaccio - this dish was really good but there was not a lot of beef. 

Overall, the atmosphere was really nice. The food are overpriced.  The portion of the food was also for snacking. It was a good experience, probably would not dine here again, as I would rather spend the money on different restaurants.",3

I ask every time If the produce is organic sometimes they say yes. Today they said ""it's all fresh"" what does that have to do with organic? Also I order the smoothie with CACAO and see them put in COCOA a huge difference. 

I drive 25 mins to them because they have vegan options. Today is the second time they said ""chefs won't be in till later"" who opened a restraunt without a damn chef???? There going downhill as fast as fresh mama. Looking forward to them closing and reopening a real restraunt",1

I called on Monday to schedule an appointment for a new fuel cap and an oil change.  I was told to come in Wednesday at 3.  When I got there, no one greeted me and it took over an hour of me waiting to get the oil change without any one checking in with me.  When I went to pay, I asked the manger to fill out my form from emissions stating that I got a new fuel cap.  He looked puzzled and when I asked if they put the cap on he said that I had to ""help him out"" by telling him ahead of time.  I stated that I asked for that when I called for my appointment.  He told me that I had an appointment at two that I showed up late for (my appointment was at 3) and then he told me that I never even had an appointment.  That was interesting since he took my call on Monday.  I was fine with them not doing the cap since it's an easy fix, but I'm not okay with someone telling me that it's my fault for something they guys didn't do.  I don't feel that I or any other customer deserve to be treated in that manner.  I'm sorry to say that I can no longer go back to that shop.  I should have trusted the yelp other reviews.",1

cgOyqKaLOxGPpxdFtq9mvg,"The DEA should plan an undercover sting operation there, because whatever substance they use for the batter must certainly be illegal in the 50 states and territories. That is some potently addictive tasty chicken they serve there.
The inside is juicy and tender due most likely to a phenomenal brining method, but the fried batter is what stands out. Surprisingly still light and not overly greasy. 
The side sauce option is good, but in my personal opinion not what makes Cane's an outstanding fast food option.

As for the rest of the sides on the menu: Greasy carbs, fried carbs and fatty greens (Toasted Texas Toasts, french fries and coleslaw). I usually skip the sides in fear of turning to carbs myself. It is just too much of it. 
If you go for a side, the Toast are good but maybe too greasy when already eating fried chicken. Fries are actually not too bad, but Cane's will never win ""Best Fries"" award. Cole slaw is better than KFC (I know. Why make a comparison to something not worth it).

As for service, the staff is always very courteous, friendly and thorough (Even though in the past they forgot 1 of my chicken fingers on a drive-thru run).

They met up with us about 1.5 months before the wedding to go over the kind of booth that we wanted. The day before, totally unbeknownst to us, Dan took a separate trip to the reception hall just to make sure that all of the logistics were in place for them to set up. During the wedding, there was a line for their booth the entire night! They have amazing options for all the photos, from cool props that people can wear to different backgrounds to things that can be written or placed into the photos to make them more fun. You can also give them an album and then people will be able to put their photo into the album as soon as it is taken and can write a message next to the photo. You are given access to an online gallery and USBs featuring all the photos from the entire evening. All of this comes at a very reasonable price. Every guest that we spoke too had such a great time with the photo booth! Overall, we are so happy that we chose to have TapSnap at our wedding, and from now on will never use any other photo booth company for social occasions.

It's located inside Seafood City, a place I avoid at all cost. Space is small so it's always CROWDED. So, I call ahead and hubby picks up the food for us or I have it delivered.

First up for review... the chicken curry. It was my mistake to order curry at a pho restaurant. The chicken was dry and the curry itself was bland.

The pork rice wasn't any better.  The rice was hard and the pork had no flavor.

The best out of the 3 dishes we ordered was the meatball pho and even that wasn't good.  The noodles were all stuck together and their meatballs tasted like they had just been defrosted from the freezer.  The only thing that was decent was their broth.  It was flavorful, but that was it.",2
e8zbKYFd8sVeqFP3T07Nfw,"Me and a friend stopped in on a weeknight. I had made reservations, but they weren't needed. (see above) I'm told that it is pretty packed during lunch.    We ate outside, so I can't really comment on the interior.  From what I saw, it has a sleek modern look.  The patio outside is small but the tables are well spaced and you are under an overhang to help keep the sun directly off of you. Which is awesome for those of us who shave their heads. (It's a lifestyle choice, dagnabbit)

I asked the server what they recommended and got a few good recommendations along with the suggestion that I had to try the African Peanut Stew.  Who am I to disagree?  So I got that and their BLT while my friend got their veggie big mac. Which is exactly what it sounds like, a big mac, but totally vegetarian.  

A word before I go on. The server brought an entire bottle of water for our table so we could serve ourselves. For those of you who have had the unique pleasure of dining with me, this was the 2nd best thing that a server could do. (the 1st being ""our meal is on the house"" of course)   

The peanut stew arrived and was delicious.  I found myself scraping the bottom of the bowl wishing for more, when I remembered I had ordered the small version.  Damn my fastidious calorie counting.  The flavor is heavy on peanut, but mixes in curry as well.  My friend and I split our sandwiches, so I had both the BLT and veggie big mac. I loved the presentation of the veggie big mac and thought it was delicious, but overall I thought the BLT was a bit tastier.  The egg and toasted bread being the standouts for me.

Service was quick and attentive, but again as the only ones there, I cannot say it is always like this. In a complete stunner for myself, no alcohol was ordered so I cannot comment. 

I went back and forth between 4 & 5 stars for Pura Vida. But really, the 4 stars would only have been because when I got there at 6:30 on a weeknight ,the place was completely deserted.  That doesn't seem fair, so five stars it is.

 I do have to say to give this place a try, inventive dishes, good service, reasonable prices and a great location in downtown Cleveland.",5

Hotel is in the middle of the strip walking distance to most other major hotels and shows, they have a great nightly show the in the front of the Hotel called the Sirens of TI. room rates range from $45 and up you can get a better deal if you shop online. the room I had had 1 king sized bed a large bathtub cable TV is free with the room, I had a flat panel tv in my room, rooms have a mini refrigerator and a safe to lock you personal items in, you can peek a smoking or non smoking room. there is a Starbucks located on the casino level.

I felt like I was treated as if I was stupid because I didn't know every single detail about the juices they had on hand. I told them I normally vape 100% VG juices (Velvet Cloud Vapor) and like custard flavors and wanted to see if they had anything similar. The response I got was ""There are no 100% VG juices."" and that was it. I then stood there for at least a minute in silence until they finally spoke up & recommended a flavor. 

Maybe it's not a big deal for other people, but amazing customer service and helping a customer in need is something I'd expect from a decent business. Instead, I felt like the odd guy out and like I was dumb & didn't belong there. 

Checking out went pretty well, but at that point all I cared about was paying and leaving. Sadly, despite having great products, I'm not sure I will return to here.",2

It has lost some of its class. It use to be a quiet, intimate atmosphere. It now has a hectic feel to it. The background noise is terrible. But to the dinner. We love the chilled seafood platter. It is still good but the crab legs were soggy and size of the platter has decreased by a third, with an increase in price. 
My wife had the Australian lobster. It was cooked perfectly and was delicious. I had the dry aged bone in ribeye. I always order it med+. It arrived undercooked. I did not send it back but probably should have. The sides have always been excellent. We split the steamed asparagus and mashed potatoes. Still excellent.

If someone takes your order, begins the crepe and finishes cooking it...they should complete the order instead of leaving the crepe to get cold while you go to the register to take other orders. That's NOT how you work an order. 5-10 minutes later the employee goes back to finish the crepe...and then loads it up with whip creme when I specifically said no whipped creme. Now I have to wait another 10 minutes for a new one? No thanks. Asked for my money back and left. Never again.

So today I prep my area for work, bring in some additional block for patches, take time off work, etc.  Its been raining for days here in town and the concrete needs protection from over spray of the blasting, and he won't do it because the tape won't stick, which is fine.  But instead of coming back when I contested him not protecting my new concrete, he called me a nasty name in Spanish and walked off the job, ignoring my questions of whether he was coming back when everything dried out.  When I texted he simply said find someone else.

For Lunch menu items, I had their sushi, and their mac n Cheese was to die for (Have you ever EATEN or SEEN mac n cheese at a buffet?? It normally looks hideous). Their prime rib was moist, but steer clear from their taco bar  because although the guac was DELICIOUS their meat looked like ""mystery meat"" . fresh Veggies, sushi, etc...

You can access this trail via a lot of points - it's actually the first registered section of the Trans Canada Trail. We accessed it through a frail yet charming town of Inglewood, right off of McLaughlin Road. To those staying in Mississauga and Brampton, you can basically take the road straight down to the trail. Apparently, it isn't a hidden secret and tons of people know about this trail. We went at 7 am and saw a few bikers and some walkers. We hiked down with Caesar (my doggo) and it was serene and empty enough that I could let him off leash. We covered about 10km (past hwy 10 and then back). 

It's an easy hike as the land is pretty flat, a few ups and downs here and there but nothing too rough. It was mostly pebbled path with trees on both sides and some streams of water that Caesar was so KEEN on jumping into. There were 2 concrete bridges we crossed over - all in all it was a great morning walk with the dog. I highly recommend this place.",5

We must've made 4 U-turns before we could find something within walking distance (and you definitely want to be within walking distance in that area)!! When we finally got there, there was quite a line which made me want to leave but like I said we were on a mission! Luckily the line moved very quickly, 10 minutes at the most. Once inside the place is not quite how it looks on tv but that's the magic of television, right? It's small & full of ""souvenirs"", my husband really wanted to look at the guitars but there was only about 4, not a big selection. To me it's EXACTLY what I expect from a pawn shop, which isn't much!! All in all I'm glad I saw it so I don't have to have the urge to see it anymore but my husband was pretty disappointed!

TiK-09uf6pMqy_74C9XxEw,"Christians, listen to a mother's prayer for you... find another therapist who shares similar beliefs and values. Ask questions, pray and be VERY careful who you hire to help you. In defense of my once brilliant, beautiful, full of promise and hope 36 year old daughter- who may DIE today on the streets of San Francisco as a mentally sick, hardcore heroin addict... and as a Christian Mom who has wept endless tears and loves my daughter to the depths of my soul... my story needs to be shared. Remember- just because someone's got a degree in mental health and years of experience... doesn't mean they've got all the answers and their heads screwed on straight. Many high priced therapists are NOT Christians nor fit to give good advice to any person or even a dog. Some therapists become therapists because they're mentally unstable and the same people who NEED therapy the most! Katy gave therapy sessions to my mentally sick drug addict daughter and psychopath, sex addict, alcoholic multi millionaire ex husband for YEARS! Katy never saw me and never asked to see me. Katy just treated me like my filthy rich ex did... like I didn't exist. She didn't seem to want to hear what I had to say. Katy started seeing my ex and oldest daughter during our nasty divorce in the late 90's. I assume these expensive therapy sessions continued for years for two reasons; money and maybe because Katy bought the lies and told my psychopath ex everything he wanted to hear. I personally think my demented ex used Katy and her education in psychology to learn how to ""say all the right things"" and learn how to ""look the part"" of an OK guy and caring dad! Talk about help and change? After endless therapy sessions with Katy, my wealthy pervert ex married his 17 years younger mistress. No one helped him to change nor understand his addictions and mental illness. Several therapists, including Katy, took his endless money while he boldly embraced his lies and immoral, selfish life which includes- 3 illegitimate kids by 3 other women! Instead of giving up his addictions, he eventually ""married"" one of them. He married his 17 years younger mistress who now gives therapy sessions and ""help"" to sexually aggressive, troubled teen boys at a private group home in Utah! (Yes. I know this all sounds nuts.) She bragged to me once that ""Katy was her personal mentor."" The mistress was 20 years old when she started having sex with my rich husband, a married man with a wife (me) and five young children. After divorcing me and leaving me with literally nothing, my millionaire ex kicked my then 19 year old daughter out of his home and rented her an apartment, This happened after he got his mistress pregnant. My oldest daughter saw Katy for years and she's still a complete mess. I wait every day for that phone call that NO mother ever wants to receive. Thanks Katy! My mentally sick daughter is a near death 36 year old heroin addict! She started using drugs when she was only 15. She became addicted to opiates bought from unscrupulous doctors that her evil dad paid for her to see. My evil ex spoiled my daughter to no ends. And, with his endless money, she went from a straight A student under my loving care... to barely graduating with a 1.38 GPA. Regardless, my ex made sure she had endless cash and a new car every year in high school! I call it the secret keeper's pay off. My daughter became my ex's ""surrogate wife"". She was emotionally raped by my ex on a daily basis... as he shared ALL his dark sexual secrets with her about his bizarre sex habits, immoral life and endless parade of young girlfriends. Today? My daughter is currently homeless, filthy, skin and bones, living in her car and walking the streets near San Francisco. My daughter lost custody of 3 children because of her drug addiction and still unresolved mental illness brought on from YEARS of emotional abuse and probable sexual abuse at the hands of her own father! Sorry Katy. I know it sucks for you to hear the truth. My family has valid information and proof from years ago, that my daughter was pregnant when she was only 15 and possibly had a late term abortion in Mexico. We still don't know who the father was... but I KNOW my ex was and still is a sexual deviate and psychopath. What really happened to my oldest daughter in my creepy rich ex husband's home so many years ago? I am not sure, as my daughter is STILL working to protect her dad. I know I am a survivor. I survived to tell this TRUE horror story from my family's past. For as badly as ex-husband mentally, emotionally and sexually abused me... surely, he has terrible secrets with my oldest daughter. Regardless of how I've reached out to help my daughter... and begged her to go to rehab... I fear we will never know for sure what happened to her... as my mentally sick, drug addicted daughter seems more prepared every day to take these dark secrets with her, to her untimely drug addicted grave. Thanks Katy for everything!",1
t6NWsgWeL-bdZKbhWAi4GQ,"WOW, while in Vegas enjoying some down time I wanted to eat at local places since I had been burned out by all the food on the strip. My sister recommended this place because she had previously stumbled into Fremont street and they were having a BBQ festival. She said they could be the best ribs she has ever had. Naturally when I hear the best I hype it up myself. This place surpassed whatever expectations I had hyped up myself. The portions were huge we had enough for dinner for 2 people and then some. Next time I Visit Las Vegas this will be one of my first stops I make for food. I had the ribs, brisket, chicken and each was stupendous!!!!",5
IUXN8Q1dzFuiAgTSqC1Kzw,"Cox has been fucking up for me for the past few months.  First they offered for me to try cable w/free HBO channels for only $17 extra or so a month around Christmas time.  They assured me if I cancelled there would be no fee or anything and I could just go back to my regular internet bill.  When I called to cancel it a month later cause of course I don't use it, they told me that it would increase my internet bill by removing it due to a new spike in prices in my service area.  I was furious.  They helped by offering to take off $25 a month and I could keep everything, but I hear they do that anyway for anyone threatening to cancel. 

While I was getting that fixed, the agent saw an upcoming charge of about $100 that she was unfamiliar with.  She wanted to check on it for me, and after being on the phone for an hour and being transferred back and forth between the same two departments because neither of them knew why it was on there, she ""did something"" to assure me that it wouldn't come out for my February payment.  Well February came and Cox charged me $194.  I called and a guy helped me out, and said that was a mistake and it shouldn't have charged to me.  He promised a physical check of $131.69 would come in the mail (since it was impossible to debit it back to my account).  I just got my bill in the mail today for March and that $131.69 was not sent back to me but showing up on my bill as a credit to my account.  I am furious they haven't resolved this, I just spoke with a new girl and she also promised to help get that back to me and to follow up with me.  We'll see where that goes but ever since that first guy I've been taking down everyone's names and what we talked about and the dates we were in contact which I recommend everyone to do with every call center ever due to issues like this happening all the time.  I'm seeking other internet providers now.",1

NUgU_LYNbW76D_iYdfIsog,"I was replacing a 2004 Pilot that I bought brand new and loved, and we had to have a car we could tow behind our motorhome like we did the Pilot.   We were looking for a used Honda CRV, 2014 or older with low mileage, leather seats and preferably a light color.  We found one I thought I liked, but drove it and didn't really like the seat comfort as much as I would have hoped.  The first and second trip I didn't really consider any others.  I looked at a few, but not seriously. Then the more I thought about it, I decided that would be a good car.  When we went back two days later, it was gone.  The gentleman who helped us the next time was Rich Edis.  He got the keys to ALL the CRVs and we looked and sat in every one.  Rich was very patient and kept the process easy, not pushy, but was there for any questions.  He was a natural fit for us, our personalities just meshed.  I made a decision that day and bought the car and drove it home.  Easy as that.  I didn't even cry when I said bye to the old one.",5

bbM52doRljeRkYgnLtx2ig,"Came here again.. this place is good.. we like it.. it has yummy pizzas, it's BYOW, and has a lively atmosphere.. there's just something a bit miss with the service I feel.. you constantly feel rushed, the staff barely stand still to take your order and midway through appetizers (at about $15 each) mains are slammed down as soon as they're ready followed by the check mid meal.. everything is attended to it just seems rushed and a bit frustrated.. my wife made the observation that it was all male staff, and maybe they need a female on the team, which we thought was funny..

otherwise we like it.. great pizzas, but it'd be nice if the guys took 4.5s to just say and act out some basic pleasantries etc. at $30 per person, i don't think it's that crazy to feel a need for..",3

lL1UWbKGA8L1CMTcNH9vVA,"This was my first visit ever to Maggiano's, based on several recommendations from friends and family. The first thing i noticed when arriving was the apparent lack of seating in the waiting area. A few more chairs or even a comfy sofa would have been appreciated. The restaurant was dimly lit, obviously to set the mood. Seating was surprisingly quick, but the wait service was surprisingly slow. I was amazed how long it took for the waiter to come by the table just to greet and take drink orders. The food was certainly above par for most italian restaurants in the area. I am a fan of the pasta dishes, particularly the rigatoni - D. I was happy to take part in the buy 1 dinner, take one home promotion that had started a few days before my visit. Like i said, the speed of service needed to be ramped up a tad, as the restaurant was not overly crowded. The one thing i was a little taken back by, was the restrooms on the second floor. It seemed a little out of the way and slightly inconvenient for those folks, like myself, who had never dined there before. But, the food quality and upscale atmosphere makes up for it quite nicely.",4

8qWtJraJcVHSh38pZwu85w,"I went here last Thanksgiving week when visiting boyfriend's parents in North Scottsdale and it was memorable. 

I am STILL dreaming about that amaretto milkshake with roasted marshmallow. My boyfriend's family made fun of me while I slurped the last bit in the backseat of the car; they know I am weight-conscious and not in the habit of drinking milkshakes, but this was SO good. 

I would give it a 5 but the service is really slow at night if they're busy and even still, I sensed a general confusion overall. 

The pizza could have a thinner crust but it was excellent and all our appetizers, including that fig bruschetta, were terrific. 

The price is very low to a person from LA, SB, NYC or other coastal city. And the WINE is really cheap! Decent glasses (not happy hour) for 6 to 7. 

I love this place and can't wait to return in 7 weeks when we go back for Thanksgiving",4
WpEPxbaWdYGpn0YgGlPC6w,"Use this firm at your own risk!  They are NOT half price. Their rates are comparable to much better attorneys in town. If you use them be prepared for a cookie cutter, impersonal, jam a square peg into a round hole type of experience. 

Been trying to get an owner, partner, or anyone who cares about this firm's consumer reputation to return my call for over a week now. Very poor experience!  In fact, the experience has been so poor that I will likely leave $500 in prepaid services to this firm on the table so I can hire a different firm that will give my case some personal attention. 

Might be good for some meaningless traffic type work but if you have any important legal matters you would be well served to look for a more personalized experience.",1

We were with visitors and wanted a higher, 'more impressive' lobster mountain' so instead of having the lobster cooked 4 ways, the server suggested we cook it 3 ways, perfect! :D We chose to have the lobster claws cooked with (duck) yolk and it was soooo delicious!! 

The service was as friendly and fast as when we came for lunch. There's only 2 seatings for dinner so make sure you make a reservation before coming in.",5
C7_tbN4UqMBxwCQZl-3rlw,"3.5 stars.  I've read numerous glowing reviews about Noca, but my experience there was unfortunately disappointing.  At some point I'll give it one more try with hopes that last Saturday was an ""off-night,"" but it won't be anytime soon.  I'm sure many of you die-hard Noca lovers are fuming right now, but this was genuinely a 3.5 star experience.

Our server was polite but overly rushed all night, which eventually became uncomfortable.  I began with a ""JR's Ripper 12"" cocktail (Citron Vodka, Pama Liqueur, Fresh Squeezed Grapefruit, Jalapeño Essence).  It took 15-20 minutes to receive the first drink, which is just silly, but it was a spectacular concoction.  I highly recommend the Ripper, it was refreshing and the essence of jalapeno did not make it spicy, just added a very unique background flavor.

A significantly long amount of time passed yet again to take our dinner order, but luckily we were enjoying each other's company enough to not worry too much (yet).  

I started with the Crudo Salmon, which was truly exceptional.  I have never had better quality salmon, and the preserved lemon & pine nut accompaniment were a perfect pairing. 

For my next course, I tried the Chitarra Pasta with Prawns.  

Me: ""Could you please recommend a wine for the Prawn Chitarra?""
Rushed Server: ""Red or White?""
Me: ""Hmm, I think white would be nice with the Prawns...""
Rushed Server: ""Pinot Noir.  I'll bring you one.""

While I highly doubt she didn't know Pinot Noir was a red, I was annoyed that she didn't listen to me, didn't make eye contact, and didn't recommend a particular brand, just said ""I'll bring you one"" and ran off.  It was a very good Pinot Noir though (of course it was- she brought me the most expensive by the glass.)
My final course was the pork chop.  It was a huge, beautiful cut of meat, with the fatty edges just starting to crisp.  However it was cooked medium-rare, which I am aware is the proper, foodie-way to eat pork, but I do think it should have been mentioned to me upon ordering.  I am ok with medium to medium-well, but rare to medium-rare is just too much for me.  That little piggy was still slightly breathing.
It was seared in foie gras and paired with a Dijon spaetzel which sounds simply divine, right?  But, there was too much going on- too much salt, too much seasoning, just too heavy in general.  The saltiness was borderline overpowering.

The lag between courses was awkward- entrees took too long and the supplements came much too fast.  Speaking of the supplements, they were so-so.  One was a diced beet salad of sorts, but because the ""supplement server"" was also so incredibly rushed he barely had time to mumble the full description.  I don't think he bothered to even attempt at describing the second supplement.

The inattentive service and ""pretty"" good food made for a 3.5 star evening.",3

I have always had exceptional customer service there. That is my honest reason for the 5 stars. I would have probably never wrote a review for this place except for last week it was late and I was going through the drive thru for some quick burgers. The place is being remodeled so you cant go in but the drive thru was open. They had a new employee working that night. Not sure of his name but the kid with the braces gave me better customer service than I have recieved in most actual restaurants. Smily and friendly. He really stood out. That being said it made me realize that all the employees I have came in contact with there have been exceptionally nice.I have been there when they experienced thier debit machine going down and after waiting in the drive thru forever they gave me my food for free and apologized. Kudos to this location on customer service!

I suggest the double cheeseburger btw! :)",5

I'm not a huge fan of flavored sodas so I tried a 'social' sugar cookie, which is a smaller version of their frosted cookies.  My husband loved his Raspberry Dream Dr. Pepper.  We'll be back - any place that offers cookies in a drive thru is a winner in my book! (Taylor M. is right, the cookies are refrigerated.

The sandwiches are big!!! The roast beef was pilled high and very dry. So dry my wife didn't eat it. On my French dip it did not have extra cheese!!!! I don't care how much it is just put the shit on the sandwich! 40.00 for 2 sandwiches. The condiments are in packages not fresh. When you say NY Deli I expect way more.

All of it was very simple and easy to grasp. While out on the tour, they made sure to stop every so often to let the slower group catch up, as well as to make sure we were all ok, and having a good time.

It's only a weekend run but who really needs doughnuts 7 days a week ;) I did the FTD on a weekly routine for awhile with my bf. It came with hot Vermont maple syrup, whipped butter, and house made blueberry jam. It was usually big enough for me but he's a bigger guy and would also get the blueberry cheesecake donut which he said was the best sweet pastry hes ever had. In addition they also have homemade chocolate milk and cold brew on tap which alone is worth the trip. Awesome friendly staff and a quick in and out experience.

Uulf2_4rrL9_PxKMXuAVEw,"I booked a Sunday- Thursday ( 4 night stay) at this hotel.   I stayed in the Club Tower which is about a 10 minute walk to the back of the Tropicana property. The hotel should issue segues for the guests to get back and forth from the casino to the Club Tower because it's way too far from the entrance. 

Then came the room. I was not at all happy with this hotel room. I was assigned to a room on the 17th floor and the room smelt like smoke. Needless to say, I don't smoke and I hate the smell of smoke.  Also the bed sheet had a weird stain on it (see picture) . It Looked like some type of organic fluid . I called the front desk to ask for a different room and didn't get an answer after calling the first time. Called a second time and still no answer. Finally got an answer after the 3rd call to the front desk.  When they answered, the said that the smoky smell was probably due to the 18th floor being a smoking floor so they moved me to the 12th floor. The room on the 12th floor was better and there was no smokey smell in that room.

I also used the Tropicana workout facility thinking it was included in my daily rate. Unfortunately, I was wrong. I used the hotel gym for 2 days of my 4 day stay. However, the hotel charged me for 4 days. Beware, this hotel will charge you $35 per day just for using the workout faculty. If you use it for 1 day, they will charge you for each day of the entire length of your stay. 

Although I had a ""view"" of the Vegas strip skyline, you should be made aware that there is a thick black screen that obstructs your view through the window.

Finally, when I called for a late checkout on Thursday , the front desk was adamant about not letting me checkout past 12 noon unless I paid an additional $55. So, I opted to leave at just before 12 noon on my last day. However, on my last day I was interrupted by hotel staff 4 times between the hours of 10am-11:30am. The first time , someone entered my room at 10:30am without knocking and without announcing who they were. Then, at 11am, the same person came back stating that he had to clean the carpet. At 11:15 and 11:30, hotel maid service came asking if they could clean the room. They never did this on days 1-3 of my stay.

Overall, I am unhappy with this hotel and have no plans to return. The only reason why I stayed at this hotel was because the MGM, where my conference was being held, had no more rooms available.",1
FY7sHovoXl93mghiSo4InQ,"We came a long way for the all-you-can-eat crab legs and were certainly not disappointed.  The crab legs were huge and very, very good quality.  We also had calamari and it too was great.  The service was amazing, I have to say.  We actually had two folks helping us and they were both very sweet and made sure that we had everything that we wanted.  I noticed that they were also very accommodating to other table's wishes.  One lady ordered two pounds of crab legs and asked that they be brought out one cluster at a time so that they were always hot.  No problem.  

I really enjoyed this place.  It's very homey and I like looking around a dining room and seeing families enjoying a meal together.

The menu is pretty small so I got two slices of white and a cannoli which was alright. I was drunk so the pizza probably would've tasted better.

NWItrBtfQXXabtiugCrk1A,"After visiting the bank in the same building, I thought I would stop by for some sushi. It was early afternoon and I hadn't eaten lunch yet. It was quiet and the only people eating was the staff for lunch. 

In terms of the service, I thought it was ok. Obviously, I was the only person there, so I couldn't really verify the service level. I can say this though, the food came out REALLY quickly. From when I ordered to when the food arrived, was about 5 minutes. 

Now looking at the speed of the service, I can only say that most of it was prepared way before.The fish was really fresh. I really like that. The Gyoza on the other hand was a little bit cold. It tasted like it was precooked, but they didn't take the time to reheat it. The dynamite roll was pretty good. It was supposed to be cold, so I can't tell if it was made way before or made fresh. It tasted pretty good though. 

Over all, it was a pretty good lunch. It wasn't too expensive too. The dish came in at $10.00",3

The decor of the place was crazy nice, never seen a club like that ever and i been to plenty of club all over the US and the country. Vegas Clubs in general are something else ( check out Tryst ). They had girls in bath tube with just pasties and more dancers at Tao bench. Also since there is a great guy to girl ratio, the odd are in guys favor since there is so many groups of ladies that get in with no problem. 

I've partied almost everywhere in Vegas and I can honestly say that nothing amounts to the fun you'll have in TAO. No other night club is as attentive as the staff at Tao.

Q1ChBln_GtS0EGixXXcB4A,"Oh, I love this place, not to mention the treats there, it's a 'cafe' style knitting store. They have so many yummy sweet brownies and bakery for you to treat yourself a day! I always adore the SMORE SQUARE, it's really mouth watering! 
For the yarn, they carry lots of Malabrigo , sock yarn and eco friendly yarn. THe store lady is very very nice and serves very well. :)
This place is very cozy for knitters to stay there and knit. Every time I went there, I saw at least 4-5 knitters chatting and knitting over there. 
They also have some toys for kids to play (my daughter loves them). 
She has quite a lot of yarn, but not very much on patterns and needle selections. Sometimes, she has some sale yarn on some shelves , check them out near the cashier. 
She also carries some wooden buttons which are quite unique and pretty. 
Parking is not a very big issue as Queen east is not very busy, so, it's not that hard to find a spot on the street.
I love to shop there and so does my daughter, she loves to play in Purple Purl too. :)",5

EWEYZ70VtrGwIf0scMYMyw,this review is based off of customer service- the last 3 times i have ordered take out i have been extremely disappointed by the service and the wait especially due to the fact that my order was placed prior to 6 pm and monday- thurdsay...unfortunately this downtown restaurant has stopped caring. the reality is that it does not take 90 minutes to make fried rice and when people are ordering take out it's a convenience because they aren't in the mood to go to the grocery store or cook that night.,2

9h9o_v3oBACXXVrBJq2TPQ,"This is a review of the venue for a concert. 
We came here for the Trey Songz concert and it was the most terrible experience. Firstly, the ticket listed the show to start at 8:30 pm. We arrived promptly at 7:30 pm to find that there was already a very long line. We found out that the door to the concert hall actually did not open until 8:30. After waiting for 2 hours in line (which had grown to almost near Las Vegas blvd), we finally got into the venue. Trey songz did not start until 10:30. By that point, my excitement for the concert had died. To put the nail on the coffin, really drunk girls kept spilling their drinks on me until my feet were soaked. I was over it halfway through the show. Never again. Extremely disorganized venue.",1

32D-u-DgEXiMy-Wxtu6eFQ,"Came due to the gluten-free menu. 

The staff was very friendly and accommodating. And our drinks were never empty. And it has a nice vibe. I liked the leftover ropes from when this was a seafood place. 

The jalapeño deviled eggs were amazing and I had such high hopes for the rest of the meal. They were creamy and topped with a pickled jalapeño and they had bacon. To die for. 

Unfortunately, the rest of my meal was not. I opted for the egg Sammy which was egg, grease, and mayo. My mom commented that it looked like a Jack in the Box sandwich -- it did. The side of potatoes looked hopeful, but they were soggy and tasteless. 

The weirdest part was when I asked for hot sauce, they brought me a small cup of cholula instead of the bottle. I did not use the whole cup and I thought it was super wasteful and weird to provide a cup of the sauce instead of just hand over the bottle. 

My husband, the gluten free one, got their gluten free breakfast dish and before we were even finished eating, his stomach was upset. 

I wanted to like it and I would go back just for those deviled eggs, but I would be hesitant to eat anything else.",2

As one who loves spice, this hits the spot. Top that of with the sweet, char-grilled plantains! What a delight.

Super affordable. Eco-friendly. Only complaint regards the often overly-eager employees that often request to dispose of plates prematurely. Still, the food has me coming back for more! 9/10!",4

Apparently the times have changed. Tonight our party of 18 (yes a reservation was made) was subjected to some of the worst service and food I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing. We waited patiently for an hour for our house salads, which were still subpar. When my New York Strip came another 30 minutes or so later, it was well done, no where close to the medium I ordered. The list of problems, including the fact that twice I went without a refill for over half an hour,  is too long to take even take the time to write here, but I will be emailing the owner with a detailed complaint. It saddens me to take this off of my list of one of my favorite places to eat in the North Hills, but after tonight's complete debacle, I have no choice.",1

Without insurance it was only $18.  Not bad at all.

Yeah...they have fried cheese curds - it's Wisconsin - there will be cheese curds.....and they'll probably be good...anywhere. It's not a testament to the Old Fashioned - it's a testament to Wisconsin's quality of cheese.
I had the fried fish special and felt like I'd ordered Van de Kamp's.
Too loud - too long to wait. Tried the burger as well, which was recommended to me as one of the best in the city. I do not agree. Whether or not they put a fried egg on stuff...it's not superior.

X_iitvD4uhXHorwO5QeXNg,"This shop has a lot to offer in terms of service and equipment. Them being a dealership is good and they're really helpful toward new riders. I got a fixed/ single speed bike and they helped me pick out a bike along with accessories. I paid half when I ordered it, and paid the other half when I picked it up. When I left the shop they even offered me to do slight changes for free like adjusting my saddle height.

I hadn't bought some roadside tools after buying my bike for about 2 months, but I got them here. What really surprised me is that they remembered me AND what bike I got. If you bought a bike from here you get 10% off accessories. I got everything I needed, for a flat at least, here. Multi tool, mini pump, innertubes, a saddle bag, and some tire levers.

The service is good when buying accessories and again, they're really helpful when making a selection.

Overall everything they do is what I expected and more. Helpful, and also doesn't break the bank with the deals they offer. The quality of their stuff differs as well, from minimum to excellent.",5

There are usually one or 2 cooks and a single waitress so the service can be a tad slow at times. I make it a point to come here with the fam on the weekends for a nice brunch. They have a great selection of lunch foods from eggs and bacon to omelette, sandwiches and wraps. Everything comes with salad, home fried chip wedges, or sweet potato fries. The amazing thing here besides the food which in and of itself deserves 4 stars, is the price. The lunch prices are unbeatable. Today I had a smoked salmon sandwich with avocado, capers, onions and a side salad with their great house dressing. All this and a beverage of your choice for $6.50!

RaRpuHW9TMdf8fIWlEYvlw,"The shutters are beautiful and they really did have the best price around. This is the second house I have used Signature Shutters on, and I have learned to just deal with the sub-par customer service because the price for the end product is worth it to me.

When they came out to measure for the shutters, the guy was supposed to be here between 11 and 1 pm. I called at 1 pm, and then guy told me he was running late and would be at my place by 3 pm. I called again at 3 pm and the guy swore he would drop what he was doing and get to my house by 4:30. I bet you can guess what happened next. He finally showed up at about 5:45 pm.

Once at my house, it didn't get a whole lot better. Some of my windows are super high up, so the guy needed a ladder to reach them. He wasn't very careful with his ladder, and he hit my dining set and left a big scratch in one of my chairs.

It took about 5 weeks after the measuring for my shutters to be ready, and the only reason I knew they were ready is because I called to check on the progress. Lo and behold, they were ready! I'm glad I took the initiative to call.

The install went okay, but the installers weren't prepared. Even though I had reminded them of the high-up windows on the phone, they didn't bring enough ladders. Lucky for them (and me), I was able to lend them one of ours so they could get the job done. Otherwise we would have had to reschedule.

While they were installing the shutters, the installers accidentally broke one of the louvres. They assured me that they could have a new one fabricated within three days and then they would come back to repair it. That was two weeks ago. I have now had to put in another call to Signature Shutters to find out what's going on with it--the broken louvre was news to the lady on the phone. I waited a few weeks on a call back.

UPDATE: Finally someone called and they came out and fixed the louvre, about three weeks later. Despite these customer service issues, I would still use these guys again because the price is so great. I don't mind cracking the whip myself in order to save a buck.",3

We waited forever for our food, again we were the only people in there.
The food arrived in take out containers , which was fine however the food was hot , temperature hot, it was inedible . We waited a while and blew on it to cool down, still it was scorching hot. I burnt the roof of my mouth trying to eat a piece of chicken . 
The food was BLAND so my efforts were for nothing . My husbands food was just as bland and tasteless. 
Then they brought us out soup which again was to hot even after blowing on it. 
I'm sure there is a health violation for serving food at 900 degrees . I think the only way to get the food that hot is by a microwave .

ykydxXaWr_KqS9WX3XpbrA,"David F. and I agreed that having dinner at Mabuhay was like going home after a long absence, where our moms/grandmas make all of our favorite dishes and keep refilling our plates even after we are way beyond full. Except in this case, we were doing the refilling ourselves...

Although served buffet-style, the food has a definite home-cooked feel.  I've never had filipino food before, but if I were a betting woman, I'd say that this is about as authentic as you can get! The food looks a little stale sitting out in the open the way they have it - and honestly I'm surprised that they are able to keep the insects out - but you can definitely tell that the food is prepared with a lot of care. For the selection of dishes that was available during the dinner hours, the $8.99 price tag was quite reasonable.

Now on to my favorite part of the meal: the steamed pork buns. Mabuhay's steamed pork buns are hands-down the best I've ever had. Better than those at any dim sum restaurant I've been to, both in the states and abroad. If it wasn't for all of the refined carbohydrates, I would probably have the buns for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!

Finally, the owner of the restaurant is a super sweet filipino lady! As we were wrapping up our meal, she stopped by with a takeout tin full of suman (sweet sticky rice steamed in banana leaves) for us to take home and told us to grab some more on the way out. Seriously, how sweet is she? We probably looked like broke college students..

2JxLJXXGdEy928g1TKg2lg,"I came here with a few friends on Tuesday night to take part of their $1 oyster special.  Right off the bat, we ordered 150 osyters.  The waiter was a little taken back but he was glad that he wouldn't have to worry about not selling out since they ordered 200 oysters for that day.  We also ordered drinks and other dishes as well but we were mainly excited to feast on the oysters.  We ordered so many that they had to get everyone from the kitchen to help shuck the osyters.  We had to wait quite a bit but that was expected.

When the oysters came, it was a sight to dwell on.  It covered our entire table!  There were 3 sauces to choose from; a habenero, a garlic vinegrette, and a shallot vinegrette and of course lots of horseradish.  My wife wanted the cocktail sauce but they didn't have any BUT the waiter spoke to the chef and guess what??? He decided to make the cocktail sauce from scratch for us.  We were greatly appreciated and it tasted fantastic!

After polishing all of the 150 osyters, we started on the other dishes.  We ordered 2 dishes of grilled calamari, 1 poutine and a farmers's plate which comprised of wild boar sausage, mashed potatoes and slow cooked ribs.

Overall, we had a great time.  The waiter was fantastic and delieved great service to our table.  The food was also superb and not to mention the oysters were super fresh! Highly recommend this pubhouse and we will definitely return for another feast in the future.",5

The dinner was simply amazing! They literally have everything you could think of plus more. The steak and prime rib was perfect medium and juicy.

Countless amount of crab legs and shrimp dipped in juicy butter and pepper! AMAZING! 

Our server was on point with taking our plates and refilling our drinks. He also gave us our own bottle of hand sanitizer.

-AFiCTui55WDAC1tnB5kSg,"I'm always late to a party.  In this case, a few years late.  I have always wanted to try La Gourmandine, but could never find a reason to intentionally stop here.  In the past I rarely visited this section of the city, which is a pretty poor excuse.  Anyway, wrongs have been righted and all is good in the world.  At least for me.

Walking into a bakery is quite possibly one of my favorite things in the world.  I love me some bread and the smell of fresh baked breads takes me back to my mom's kitchen.  It was quite the process for my mom, so my appreciation for a fresh bread is definitely there.  It's hard not to have your mouth water when you look at what they have to offer.

I seem to be a creature of habit, or at least habitual actions.  Which is probably why I rely on items that I know have not let me down in the past.  Which is the case with the baguette aux lardons.  Where my bacon fans at?  I see you out there.  A baguette baked with bacon bits and Parmesan cheese, how could you pass that up?  It's a great snack to have and share.  I have also had a focaccia topped with pizza toppings which is quite amazing as well.

But the whole reason you come here is because you want to indulge.  Satisfy that sweet tooth of yours.  My first visit I had gotten the delice de pistache.  I love pistachio and this did not hold back on flavor one bit.  Right mixture that did not make it too sweet.  My latest visit I decided on the eclairs au chocolat.  This this is what makes you want to come back.  The filling in this was so rich that you wonder why you never had something like this before.

Oh how I wish I was there right now.  I want me some sweets badly.",5

f-8nDLW8CN8WfuzHo3U6CA,"Alright, who's ready to get their raunchy on?!  Wait, what?  What'd you mean?  Its NOT a strip club?  Oh shucks!

With a name like Shanghai Cowgirl - I can only think of how successful this would be if it were transplanted to an expat neighbourhood in Shanghai as a gentleman's club.  Alas, there were no sexy ladies here.  Only servers with plenty of tats, and a lot of ""interesting"" characters that dined here.  Almost as interesting as the plastering of bumper-sticker-like propaganda - Saigon hookers and dildos?  Those belong more in a Hangover movie than it does at a diner.  Or maybe I'm just not the right target audience for such ""artistic"" displays.  Speaking of art, you will find a wall of it for sale.  Its very emo-goth if you ask me - but hey if it floats your boat...

I came armed with a Team Buy voucher.  I had heard that this was one of the go-to places to get some decent food if you're a night owl as they are open ridiculously late.  

The booths will make any girl insecure about her size - damn are they narrow.  If you are claustrophobic than this probably isn't the place to go.  On the flip side, if you're a klutz, most of your spillage won't end up on your lap because there's but a wee crack of space between your upper body and the actual table.  

The menu is typical of a diner - fries, burgers with some fusion items thrown in there like noodle bowls, fried rice.  

I ordered the Ghetto Chicken - mostly because I was weirdly drawn to the name of the dish.  It was a disappointment.  KFC, which costs significantly less does up chicken better than this place.  The batter was a brown that was too-dark to belong on a piece of fried chicken, and blander than hospital food.  The actual chicken itself had no taste either.  It came served on a bed of (burnt) carrots, asparagus and mashed potatoes.  Sadly, the best part of the dish were the mashed potatoes, and even they needed a sprinkling of salt.

William T. got a burger with blue cheese and mushrooms.  The blue cheese added a nice creaminess to the burger but the mushrooms were virtually unnoticeable.  The sweet potato fries were depressing to look at, as they were limp and not very crispy.  

The only memorable part of the night (other than the activist male patron who sat behind us butchering his poor female dining companion about his left-wing ideas) were the Pierogies.  We got ours with char siu pork, ginger, scallions and chili pepper flakes.  It was topped with a dollop of sour cream.  I must say the sour cream is a nice touch, as they smoothed over an otherwise starchy and rather grainy pierogi wrapper.  The inside was filled with potato and cheese.  I thought the bit of sweetness from the char siu marinade and the spicy chili pepper flakes were great flavour enhancers.

Verdict:

For 3 food items and 2 drinks from the bar, our bill came up to about $62.  That's a little steep for a diner.  At about $10 for a base burger and then $1-$2 for extra toppings, a burger can set you back $15.  I think that for a diner, their price point is a little off - but then again I'm sure rent in this neighbourhood isn't cheap.  

For food that your dad can grill up on a BBQ or that your European grandmother can make, I'd say eat at home instead of dishing out at Shanghai Cowgirl.  However, since I don't have a European grandmother - I'd probably come back here - but only for the pierogies.",2

The shops were nasty the casinos were dirty as hell. The only good thing was the cheap beers that we got inside the casinos. There's nothing there but a few gift shops and the casinos. We ate at the place at the end by the parking garage(seafood place) since it looked fairly decent from the outside..mistake. It was nasty inside I felt dirty just sitting there. I just had some shots and beers since I didn't feel comfortable eating there after I tried the shrimp cocktail... which tasted old and burnt. I would come back to ride the zipline at night... other than that it was a boring waste of time!

ieRLtRGFFdupRhQ9p5UPXg,"Had a decent time but it was not nearly as much fun as I had doing something similar with the Vegas Off Road Experience last year.

Here are my issues-

1) What people really want is to shoot some guns and take some cool photos.  The website for Bullets and Burgers shows people holding cool guns and or getting ready to shoot where you can clearly see the person doing the shooting.  When you arrive they tell you you can only take pictures from a small barrier behind the shooter and a little to the side.  This means you are taking a picture of someones back and it could be anyone for all the person looking at the picture knows.  That sucks from an I want to remember this experience perspective.

2) The package I got says you also get to ""Walk the Hoover Dam Bridge"".  I have never been to the Hoover Dam so I assumed this meant I would be on the Hoover Dam.  Not so.  I got to take a quick hike to a bridge that looks at the Hoover Dam from quite a distance away- What???",3
yNtRY_zxxeImZ6aWwJlziw,"I have been staying at the Vdara for the better part of a year on a regular basis, at least once or twice a month. Over the past year I have always been a huge customer advocate for the Vdara and told my friends and business associates that if they are traveling to Vegas your hotel should the their destination of choice.
 
However over the last couple of months, my customer experience has been less than stellar and I will no longer frequent your hotel during my Las Vegas business trips. Here is a summary of my experiences and how they have effected by decision.
 
In speaking with my business counter part, who stays as frequently at Caesars as I do at the Vdara, he is upgraded with each visit to either a higher floor or larger room. In addition he is always thanked for his loyal patronage and told how much they appreciate his continued business. On my most recent stay (March 2 - March 5) when I checked in, I explained to the employee that many of my previous room charges had not credited to my MLife Account. She said she would look them up for me and when she accessed my file she said ""Boy, you stay here a lot"" and then gave me a card with a phone number to cal for assistance with my issue. No, thank you for your loyalty Mr Harris or I am so sorry for this inconvenience Mr Harris; just I cant help you but here is a card with a number to call. Stellar service.
 
During my previous stay in February I left two iPhone chargers in the room and asked during my current visit if they could be in a lost and found. The front desk employee was very nice and called the department for in that morning, but then found out that it did not open until 11 AM. She said that she would follow up and call me on my mobile phone with an answer. To this date I still have not heard from anyone, so I will assume nothing was turned in or there was no follow up from the employee.
 
I was also quite shocked on Tuesday morning when I went to the Fitness Center to find out it was under construction. A nice employee at the Spa said that I could use the Aria Fitness center at no charge if I showed by room key, but as it was 49 degrees that morning and I was wearing shorts and a T-shirt that was not ideal. When I asked where the Fitness Center was located in the Aria she said that I could ask the Door Man for directions when I arrived. Really?? Should this not have been something that the front desk notified me of when checking in? Should there not have been some map provided to me at check in with this information? Why was I paying a daily resort fee of $30+ a day and not have use of a fitness center? Lovely.
 
To your credit, the Valet team are amazing. When I arrive each time they always say "" Welcome Back Mr Harris"" even though they have not seen me for two to three weeks. Perhaps this is because I have a bright orange car or because I am a big tipper, but they are the only ones who treated me like a loyal and valuable customer. I would recommend whoever manages that department is promoted to manage the front desk for a better overall customer experience.
 
So now I have a Total Rewards Card and have booked my first room at Caesars next week. I realize that I will be starting over again with a new program, but I am looking for a company to recognize my loyalty and thank me for my patronage. Somehow your hotel seems to have lost that focus and for that, I am truly disappointed.",1

YFDZqIQPaFSL7iBJLfapJA,"I'll be honest, I probably would never have come here if it wasn't for the fact that my friend had a Total Rewards dining coupon, and this was one of the places to choose from. But I'm glad I did!  

Despite its totally unpretentious cred (in the Flamingo, no celebrity chef, no fanfare or hoopla), this turned out to be a solid steakhouse experience with a little extra flair in the form of a unique and fabulous foodie appetizer called the bacon satay trio (photo attached, but doesn't do it justice). This is served as 6 slices of super-thick-cut bacon (about 1/4""thick!) and a roasted Jalapeno pepper on a huge rectangular block of pink Himalayan salt, with bleu cheese and spices and a pot of honey-bourbon syrup dipping sauce. FUCK, YEAH! I'm not even a big bacon fan, and this was amazing!

The rest of the food was good, but nothing special: I had the garbage salad and a fully-loaded baked potato, both of which were great, but nothing you couldn't get elsewhere. My friend had a filet ($41 with Total Rewards card, $44 without), which he said was fine as well, but again, nothing you couldn't get a million other places in Vegas. We also shared a bottle of wine.

Overall, despite the ""nothing special""ness of the food, it was one of the best meals I've had in a LONG time! Granted, I was high at the time, so that may have had some bearing on my taste buds...but I honestly think it was the bacon appetizer that set the tone and really made the meal. That thing was REALLY good! 

Service was good, ambiance is sort of cruise-chip-modern -- sort of a cheapo version of the sort of chi-chi steakhouse decor you see at other more expensive Strip steakhouses. There are TVs all over the walls, which at the time of my visit were playing an NFL game, lending a definite casual vibe -- and the guests were dressed to match; flip flops, board shorts, very casual dress. But some of the TVs were also playing slideshows of old photos of Vegas, which I found pretty interesting and cool, and lent a sort of old-Vegas vibe.

The one sad failure was the bread basket, which consisted of two lame soft-bread rolls of uninspired pedigree. But, since bread is poison, this could actually be looked at as a huge plus -- less carby nastiness to tempt you.

Anyway, if you must have steak at the Flamingo, by all means I recommend this place. But there are bette/more interesting steakhouse experiences in town, at similar price points.

What I would recommend here is just sharing appetizers at the bar -- not sure you can do this, but they have a pretty swanky lounge out front, with a better view/ambiance than the actual restaurant, and if you could sit here and have some drinks with your bacon satay, it would be a pretty cool evening.",4

2vuU73XsvJP4pTHVU7zlrQ,"Okay folks, this ain't our first rodeo when dealing with Cruise America RV Sales. We bought a 2010 Majestic 19G from the Carson, CA location back in Feb 2013. Since then, we have put more than 25 thousand miles on the rig. Routine maintenance, a set of tires, and a flush valve in the toilet has been our only expenses (not counting an occasional power wash). We bought the extended warranties on the chassis and the interior, and have never had to use either one. Using truckstop fuel, our mileage has been 11-12 mpg.

Nearly three years later, the story continues...we just traded up to a 2011 27G. After two or three phone calls to Dave Jones at the Mesa, AZ location, we drove from Texas to see and buy a larger rig. We arrived just before noon. Mr. Jones was there to greet us and show us several rigs. A serious test-drive confirmed our choice. We chose the 19G's bigger brother, the 27G.

Lunch and a short negotiation period later, we received a fair trade-in and did the necessary paperwork. A cashiers check and a title swap, the deal was done. It took an hour or so to transfer our ""stuff"" out of the 19G into the 27G...done and out the gate just before dark.

Had to go back the next day for a couple of nit-picky gripes to be fixed ( a broken passenger armrest and a loose side mirror). After about an hour and a 43 gallon fill up, we were soon in rush hour Phoenix traffic on our way to San Diego. A gas top off on Yuma figured that we were getting 10 mpg at 65 mph...not bad considering the larger size rig and the much larger Triton V-12.

This RV will probably our last; however, if we want another one...we will return to Cruise America.",5

The menu had a wide variety of apps and burgers to choose from, so many of which sounded unique and promising we knew if we liked it we would have to come again. We ordered the steamed Pork Belly buns as apps and for burgers, the Ronin and Kiki. The buns were interesting, but just a bit better than okay. Glad we ordered it but no reason to get it again. To clarify i probably would order buns again, but a different variety. Now, on to the burgers...

WOW!!! Both burgers (I tried my wife's Kiki) were amazing! I described it to my wife as an explosion in my mouth. Fireworks were going off... The burgers contained a melange of flavors and textures... I actually used the word melange for the first time in my life! It was an orgasm for the mouth. There was sweet and salty and spicy and juicy, crunchy, soft, and crisp...ohhhhh! Give me a moment, I will be okay. We also shared the Garlic Parmesan Truffle fries... Also wow. Strong and intense in flavor there was only so much one can eat in a sitting... as it strains the taste buds, but not in a bad way.

I had Honeydew bobo tea, which was very nice as well, no worse or better than any I have had before, and the wife had the root beer.

You will have to exit either at H&M or Best Buy and Joey's is a few steps away. In the summer, it's a beautiful place to get food and drinks on their ""patio"", which is essentially their tables by the windows, except the windows aren't there. I came here TWICE yesterday - once for lunch and once during happy hour. I'll detail both experiences below:

I came for lunch with a group of 6. They don't allow reservations for lunch hour, but we didn't have to wait for a table anyways. We were seated upstairs in a booth, and our waiter brought us water right away. I ordered the California chicken burger with fries for $16. Food didn't take long to arrive, and it I appreciated that they brought out all 6 dishes at once, unlike other similar restaurant chains (*cough* Milestones *cough*). The fries were a little salty, but I still thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Our waiter was amazing (I think his name was Joe, but I'm not 100% sure). He asked us if everything was good with our food twice and at the end of our meal, he played some trivia games with us. If any one of us got the answer right, he said he would pay for our pop (we didn't get either of the 2 trivia questions right).

A few hours later, I came back for happy hour. We had a group of 8 or 9, but they didn't have any tables big enough to accommodate us so we just kept adding chairs to the booth. Despite such a large group and some people not actually drinking (like me), our waitress, Rachel, was very sweet and brought drinks quickly. Happy hour also includes food so there's something for everyone!

Overall, food and service is great, but this place is definitely on the pricier side. For around $20 per entree, I would expect bigger portions. Location is very convenient, especially since my school is right next door, so Ill definitely be back again soon!",4

So much things to choose from and it doesn't come in big quantity so you can taste a lot of things without being to full.

Personally I didn't like the food, everything tastes the same, some kind of spice or something. Not a great choice of alcohol, shots were super expensive. The wine was good :)

If you wanna try something new, this is a place for you!",3

uESkdPY1n8CQQHr3LtUUMg,"My workout friend recommending Lulu's for an amazing breakfast and so we decided to drop in on 05/27/18. 

We walk in with no one else in line, I stand there for a few minutes trying to read what I think is the menu. I realized the menus were on paper by where you order. I read over it and the breakfast burrito immediately stands out. I tell the girl taking my order that I would like that breakfast burrito and instead of the eggs if I could get egg whites. She tells me no because the burritos are made in the morning and can't be taken apart and remade ‍‍. I then then order the turkey burger as an alternative. 

My 3 friends and I head outside to the patio to enjoy the weather and talk. After about 10 minutes we see a woman get up from her seat angrily and head into the restaurant ........... and another 20 minutes pass and a man also does the same thing ........... sure enough we had to wait 45 MINUTES for our food and this is why everyone was becoming so enraged. 

I couldn't bare to see this place on a busy day albeit my turkey burger was pretty decent, the service , wait time, and inability to make alterations were a real turn off for me.",2
8WwQK6FpayvUAMa63VfDjQ,"That hit the spot!  While we were visiting Las Vegas we had a craving for some good Mexican food and were not disappointed. This place is worth the trip away from the Strip for sure. I would definitely come here again.  Our party had the shrimp tacos, cheese enchiladas, chile relleno, carnitas tacos, and shrimp cocktail and we liked it all!  Prices are more than reasonable, and they cook with soybean and canola oils which made it very easy to eat here with a peanut allergic person in our party.  The staff and management are very friendly and welcoming as well.",5

0QfYJwv2d9SrNvFHiDIfBA,"I would give this 5 stars except for one thing, it's only Mexican food.  How much can you dress up Mexican food...really?

The place was very clean and well decorated.  The hostesses wore beautiful traditional Mexican dresses.  We were immediately greeted and shown to our seats.  The musician/karaoke man in the corner was a bit loud, but not obnoxiously so.  He went out of his way to entertain our kids with some personal attention, a song while wearing a funny mask.  (They LOVED it!).  As a matter of fact, the entire staff were completely friendly and helpful.  Everyone went out of their way to make sure our experience was pleasant and enjoyable.  The prices were very reasonable too.

There's not much you can do with Mexican food, let's be honest.  But it was very good, as Mexican food goes.  The EXPERIENCE and customer service we were given earns Casa Don Juan 4 and a half stars in my book.  I highly recommend this restaurant.",4
V4DJZ9_SbeVZB_ahpc5d3w,"This is my first time at Pan and I'm just blown away... The atmosphere is so homey but classic, with dim lighting, beautiful chandeliers and detailing in the ceilings, wine racks everywhere and simplistic booths and hardwood flooring. It's intimate and quiet, which I love, great place for a date for two but even a family night. There are some tables by the window for a nice view of the danforth, but also a back portion of the restaurant which is more private. They also have a small patio which is nice for warm weather. 

The service is amazing, the waiters cater to your every need happily and in a timely manner. The owners are so caring and happy and ensure you leave happy no matter what!
The menu is pretty reasonably priced for what you're getting. They have a ""PanLicious"" option too, for $25 a one person can get one entree, one app and one dessert. Not bad! 

Tonight we ate the exohiko, steak, village salad, Pasta and grouper fish for entrees, and the saganaki and calamari for appetizers. Everybody was happy with the meals, the food came quickly but was cooked to perfection. I've never had a steak melt in my mouth like that. The saganaki was so exquisite, and I've tried a loooot of saganaki being Greek and all. Also before you order they serve you warm pita with five different Greek spreads that are authentic, fresh and delicious. I also tried the local Pinot Noir which was light and smooth, and had a cappuccino to wash everything down with a taste of every dessert on the menu. Dessert portions are small but rich and tasteful, served with fruit and whipped cream. The cappuccino was delightful. We didn't leave a single bite left of anything. 

I will definitely be coming back. Loved this place soooo much. One of the better Greek restaurants on the danforth.",5

L85j_xHnLZEsO32LfG58ag,"I used to love this restaurant but after this past experience, I'm never going back. The wait was long (about an hour and a half) which was typical. But this time, the cook we had. NOPE! The servers were very nice. Everything was pretty quick with our appetizers but watching the main course being made... I almost didn't eat it. But it cost so much and we waited so long I figured I should suck it up. The cook (EZ) was not a clean individual. He wiped his hands on his apron A LOT. Unlike the servers, he didn't use gloves when handling the food. It was disgusting. Is this the standard? Are people okay with this? Because I'm not. I couldn't finish my meal. This guy wouldn't stop touching stuff with his bare hands! And that apron! While this was going on(I was just focused on my food), my friend witnessed interactions between him and the other patrons next to us. This cook named ""EZ"", very obviously favored and prioritized non-colored patrons. He made facial expressions and negative gestures towards the POC at the bar. Served white people first and practically went in order of the shade of people's skin! This guy is a racist and he's a dirty cook to boot. The way he was acting. SO OBVIOUS. Never going back there. Vegas is a very diverse city. How is this guy getting away with it?! My friend and I are very disappointed.
EDIT: Reading past reviews, I have now seen that this isn't the first time racist dirty cooks have done this. Wish I would of read these before this happened.",1
GwiW5DP9LPEbGZ_wfnZg7g,"First time here for a friends birthday celebration.  Since we rolled with guys, it was more logical to book a cabana.  Ours was situated by the poolside, so we saw a lot of foottraffic .   The venue itself was georgous! 

If you've been to Tryst at the Wynn, then you'll love XS.  It's 10x bigger and decor was magnificent.

Music was good and so were the people we met throughout the night.  Definitely a must go when in Vegas.

yv0aGzbk1gCCyo8OKy0L8w,"We went to a small get together that my nephew hosted by the pool in the early afternoon on a weekday before Memorial Day. He has lived in the complex for the last 6 months. He had prepared food and brought it all from his apartment to the grill area at the pool. He had invited a few friends, most of whom are LVMPD officers or officers spouses or girlfriends. As we were all quietly visiting in one small section of the pool area by the grill one of the management came over and (in front of everyone) loudly demanded that he show his ""pool card."" He said was never issued a ""pool card"" and gave his apartment number, name and room mates name. She said that he had to have a pool card to be at the pool and that even if he had his pool card he was only allowed to have two guests at the pool. Are you kidding me? People who live in apartments are only allowed to have two friends? 
First of all, she embarrassed him in front of his friends, demanded a pool card that had never been issued to him or to his room mate. Could she have not taken him aside for her reprimand? I felt so bad for him. He sees this same woman in the office several times a week and yet she claimed to not recognize him as a resident. Ultimately she ""let him go"" with a warning and we were allowed to stay after a few derogatory comments about how a group of people would interfere with the residents enjoyment of the pool. (There were two other ""residents at the large pool area at the time) If, in fact, residents of this complex are only allowed to have two friends at the pool and cannot host a small get together around the large grill and bar area then they should make sure that they don't represent otherwise when selling residents a lease. One of the selling points to my nephew and his room mate was the pool area with the entertaining areas for their use. They apparently failed to mention that they could only have two guests. It is a very nice complex. It is just a shame that residents can only share it with ""two friends"" at a time.",2

I've eaten here 3 times so far. the first time I got take out. I always get the number 1, 3 carne asado taco plate. the second time the rice was overcooked and the beans tasted old, but the next time they were good. the tacos are always good, they put some special bbq sauce on the tacos as the owner pointed out to me. I do wish they had self serve fountain drinks, but other than that, as long as I can get some good tacos, I'm cool. Like this place.",4

rW02XIjRRqoGcEuJCVdD2g,From what my friend tells me is this place has been around a long time.  15 years ago they renovated but made the interior uglier.  Its a confusing mix of fish and chips and Thai Food.  I had the Fish and Chips to go.  They were pretty good.  This place needs some serious fresh image makeover to bring in new life and more customers.  The dining room was completely empty.  There is a fridge in the dining room.  Im told they have a nice back patio in the summer though.  Avoid the dining room and just get take out or do the patio.,3
RBHon9KLjQDYBmtYRhTczw,"We got a house. That's very exciting and very expensive.
These guys were fantastic. They called me an hour before their appointment to let me know they were still coming. They were worried they would be late as I lived further away than they had thought. They still got there ten minutes early. I explained what had been on the inspector's report and they let me know that an item listed on the report was fine, just not up to code. They showed us how to use the water softener as I had never had one before. They verified the weird contraption on a toilet was a bidet with high water pressure. (also exciting)
They started taking apart the sinks as my boyfriend went to home depot to get the new faucets it turned out we needed. They advised on brand, to make sure we got the one with the awesome warranty. They answered his calls from the store and even spoke with a floor rep to make sure he got the right things. They installed them and were gone. They were friendly and gave great advice on different ways to save money. Some having nothing to do plumbing at all. We have their sticker on our water heater tank to make sure we know who to call whenever we need plumbing done again.

Also the guys I had over believe strongly in ""what goes around comes around"" and so have honest business dealings out of self interest. They were around $175 less then we had planned on. Gush Gush Gush awesomeness.",5

xcy5hkqJ6TNIQ4dJaeweEA,"My roommate and I were planning on moving in here and had gotten accepted and paid a holding fee for an apartment to be ready on July8 . ONE week before we were supposed to move in they said that the tenants were not moving out and that they were going to take action legally. All they offered us was a partially updated bigger floor plan for a about $50 more a month, and we decided that's not what we wanted to do. The office NEVER answers their phone, we had many questions and called SEVERAL times and left SEVERAL voicemails never to be returned unless we continued to call and someone actually answered the phone. A couple days later they told us move in would be July 20, a day later they said end of July like the 30th FOR SURE, and then a day later they moved the date to August 1st. We had more questions so we called and every front desk agent we talked to said that we needed to talk to a manager and to call back at 11 on a tuesday. I called and they told me that the manager would be on break from 11-1... A 3 hour break?! Needles to say we didn't get a call back at 1:00 so I called yet again. When I spoke to the manager she told me there was NOTHING they could do and she was under the impression that we were informed information by the other agents. Management's body language and tone of voice advocates that they do not care about their future tenants. We decided to go elsewhere. Would NEVER suggest living here. Look at all the other reviews!",1

The location was really convenient. You can walk across the street and go to the fashion show mall. You could also walk to the Venetian pretty easily. There is a very conveniently located bridge to the Venetian next to a beautiful waterfall. I had a fabulous time there.

The cons:

- The cashiers don't speak English so well, so you often have to repeat yourself 2-3 times for them to understand what you want

0qerSC01pdrgCIrSjX-IWw,"This place has had its ups and downs and now in true conformity to the name of city it's in, it has risen from the ashes.

When it first opened this place was awesome:
Hentai playing in the bar area and good spicy tuna rolls which were my favorite at the time.

Over time the restaurant went downhill, the quality of the fish was lowered and overall it seemed too overpriced for what you got. The yellowtail tataki was probably the only thing that kept being good through its down phase. Hentai on the projector was replaced with weird video effects that go with the music.

Now the place has increased the quality of fish, they have fresh chopped wasabi available on request and a great selection of cold Sake. Hentai isn't back but Anime replaced the video effects. I'm happy to go to Zen 32 again.",4

i7LNaiIuKhNH4l0w3WbQaA,"I'm torn about this spot... The food is average. The beer selection is good. The location is great. 

First, the food... Your run of the mill bar grub -- burgers, hotdogs, fries. You would think the chili would steal the show but it's really pretty bland and lacks that pizazz or spice I enjoy in a good chili. 

Next, the beer selection... Lots of great, local choices on draft. 20 choices, to be exact. I like that they offer flights because I am indecisive and like to sample lots! 

Lastly, the location... I love Brevard Court. It reminds me of a little alley in Europe. It's really an oasis right in the heart of uptown Charlotte. The interior of QCBC is nice, too. Lots of sleek wood. High top tables and a few seats at the bar. It's teeny-tiny though, so if anything is happening uptown (especially a Knights Game) expect a packed house. 

So, moral of this story is, I wish they'd up their food game. I would be inclined to visit more if there was something I really loved and craved on the menu.",3

After the 3rd bite, I found a hair and I knew I couldn't choke down the poor excuse of a crepe. When I called the waiter over to complain, he said ""well, to late now!"".

VuRhVNbAIeHgJayHzAEwlw,"My wife and I have been coming to Palio since the Bellagio opened. This is a hidden little gem tucked away within the Bellagio back area near the pool entrance.  When most guests want to eat breakfast or lunch they go to the ""buffet"" or the main breakfast restaurant in the middle of the hotel. Big mistake-come to Palio!

If you are a coffee fan and also enjoy homemade pastry-this is the place for you. 
First the coffee- I am a huge Starbucks bold roast fan. The only coffee I have ever enjoyed more was actually in Italy. That all changed upon our introduction to Palio. It is the only coffee I like better than Starbucks in the US! You also get free refills. We often buy their whole bean coffee and take it home.

Their pastry's range from a standard blueberry muffin to a Nutella croissant. Everything is mouth watering. They even have some sugar free items.  Palio also serves small breakfast and lunch plates. For breakfast or lunch I highly recommend the Muesli with fruit and the yogurt parfait with fruit. The smoked salmon ""pie"" is awesome. Overall, it is pricey but worth every cent.  

There is no waiter service. You order from the counter and either take the items out with you or eat at one of their beautifully decorated tables in the restaurant (seat yourself).The line during prime morning hours can get long but it moves.

If you are used to the standard Vegas breakfast-try Palio. Don't be afraid-go crazy and order some of the extravagant pastry's or small plates. Definitely get a coffee and enjoy the best coffee in the US (with Starbucks a close second).",5

the one thing that was really off-putting on this trip was when we ordered a side of fries the server asked if we would care to make them truffle fries for a ""small upcharge""?  my bad for not asking how small.  I think the fries were $5 and the upcharge was an additional $13.  when questioned, the server removed the charge without hesitation but the experience made me feel like a cheap-ass and left me with a bad overall experience of the place.  just put the price on the menu if you're that proud of your truffle fries.",2

It's mostly dancing...I was expecting mostly an acrobatic show full of wow...but even the acrobatics were mild in comparison to other shows.Dancing shows are fine and all, I don't mind it. But their timing was off and almost sloppy during this particular performance (people falling behind the rest of the group, people forgetting moves, etc). I loved the special effects and lighting...I loved all the audience participation. The music was great. There were laughable moments. I did enjoy myself, but I feel the price wasn't worth it. There were about 3 or 4 performances I truly enjoyed, the rest was just kinda blah.",3

The crazy thing when we get the check at around 5:30pm it doesn't have the happy hour prices of half off. When we asked if they were the correct prices the waitress said yes that meant the margaritas were $18 really really totally not worth it and to top it off the hostess at the door said they don't really know the prices. Also seemed like they were short staffed and didn't have any napkins my sister had to easy all-you-can-eat ribs with only one napkin!  Sorry applebees i really love you but will not be returning to your Craig road location.

44t3KUm0T1d0YwnsRFXIbA,"Food: 5 stars, service: 1 star. 

We head in, about 6pm on a Saturday. The bar and the inside are packed, we're looking for a patio seat. We give the hostess our names and she quotes us 45 minutes for the patio, and tell her we are going to grab some drinks.

No drink prices on the menu. While checking out the menu, I ask a girl what the price of a drink is. She tells me she's 18 so doesn't know, ask another server or the bartender. So I ask a server. He tells me he also doesn't know, ask the bartender. I ask the bartender, she doesn't know and has to check their POS. Rinse and repeat for 2 drinks. No one seems to know the pricing. If your wait staff doesn't know, just put it on the menu. Why the guessing game? 

No seats at the bar so we head outside to at least enjoy the weather. To our surprise there are 8-9 open tables on the patio. Why a 45 minute wait??? We pick a table and sit down. The hostess comes out and tells us we can sit there, but they are ""catching up on the tables inside so can't wait on us"" - you have empty tables on a Saturday night. Why not just have enough wait staff to accommodate? It is Saturday after all. You are a restaurant in one of the busiest, trendiest restaurant districts in the city. Get it together. 

We finish our drinks. ~15 minutes later, a different hostess comes out and asks us if we need a server. We tell her yes. She hands us menus. We wait another ~20 minutes, no one has seen us and she comes out to seat another table. ""Has your waitress seen you yet?"" ""No, we don't even have waters.""

She sends out the managers. We place our order. I ask if we can at least have a drink comped. Sure. She walks away, forgetting to ask what we were drinking; comes back out a couple minutes later to ask. 

The food was delicious. It'll keep me coming back, and I'm sure that is the one and only saving grace of this restaurant and why it's still around.",2

DeU02nJKhGlfr28I7kBsaQ,"I'd love to give this salon a better review. My tech, Johnny, was so nice and the owner made me giggle the entire time I was there as I overheard him talk. Alas, I can't! 3 stars at most. 
First off, the salon is in desperate need of a good cleaning. There is nail powder covering everything, dirty cotton balls on the floor-not good. I will say that in spite of this I know he used sanitized tools, and that they line their pedicure basins. 

The biggest compliment I have is that they have like a MILLION gel colors to choose from. I found the perfect color I had in mind, and I love it. The overall job (simple gel manicure) is satisfactory, but not awesome enough to overlook the filth and general poor decor of the salon (nails in the wall, old Christmas lights, weird candy  toys adorning the wall-just, no).",3

Uy-7c0ktkmn_0gTueW7BSA,"Sigh. I guess it's inevitable. I have to write a Beauty Bar review.  Welp...here goes.

I'd just like to start out by saying I really have to give the BB kudos - they and the Griffin really stuck out their necks (and pocketbooks) to forge ahead solo on Fremont East before it became established as the hipster haven it is becoming / has become. For that alone, they earn my respect. A friend and I stopped in early one evening when they first opened - I remember a well stocked bar and foxy tattooed bartenders that were really nice to boot!

Since then I've seen some terrific bands there over the years both inside and outside on the back patio, such as Nashville Pussy (outside in freezing temps), Andre Williams, various punk rock bowling shows, and the amazing Bellrays performed to an audience of five one night stuffed into the space in one of the front window bays. That said, I seem to enjoy this place less and less each and every time I come.

First off - it's TOO FREAKIN' LOUD inside. Whether there's a band playing or a DJ spinning records the sound level in this place borders on painful. There is such a thing as a comfortable music level - even for loud rock and roll in a divey bar. I know, I know...if it's too loud, you're too old - well, maybe I am.

Secondly - BEER IN A CAN (blaaargh). The Beauty Bar used to serve bottled beer (that you would pour into a plastic cup to go out on the patio). I understand the safety concerns and the reasons behind the plastic party cup, but seriously?  Can you not have ONE decent light beer bottled or on tap? Nothing bums me out more than beer in a can. For real. 

I really want to love the BB - and I didn't mind it there for a while - but it seems to get more low budget and lackluster each and every time I go.  This last time we went my friend asked for scotch - and they stared at her quizzically before telling her they don't have scotch. At a bar. Kind of sad, when they have so much possibility to be a stellar venue.",2

TBFXrYr4GHnwvpNBjnF6WA,"I am astounded by the crazy high rating for this restaurant. It is perfectly fine, but the selection is fairly limited, and my trio signature dish was adequate but not special.

Service was a little awkward - friendly enough, but amateur. The waiter brought one diner's salad before her side dish, though she clearly ordered them together. Then it was a lengthy wait before anything else came out. This is but one example of things feeling a little off.

Worst of all, something very bad had happened in the ladies' room that we felt compelled to inform management about. So maybe I just was suffering from a lost appetite.

Fine, but I expected more.",3

We've dined here several times. We love mom and pop shops, but this cafe is only alright. There are a few places further about (10 minutes away) that have better food quality at the same price point.

Overall experience and ambience is very very very casual. Maybe a little too casual. Everything is served in and on unappetizing styrofoam. The space is cluttered with ""stuff"". A little more concern about presentation of their space and food would elevate guest experience immensely.

If you're in the neighborhood, short on time and would like some Filipino food, and are not too concerned about feeling like you might be eating in some stranger's slightly cluttered living room, then this place will probably satisfy you.",3

i2s9mEN39iMALZfgdqqEAA,"I need to start by saying they never cleaned my carpets.  I wish there was a way to write a comment without leaving an actual review or leaving a star rating.  Since there is not this is the only way I have to express my dissatisfaction.  Earlier this week I got a flyer in the mail advertising 3 rooms for $119.  I really just have two rooms that I feel need to be cleaned at the moment (plus I was going to have them do my stairs but we never made it far enough to get to that) but the mailer says the max size of each room is 250 sqft.  Well each of my rooms is just over 300 sqft (about 640 sqft total between the two) so I called to ask if I could just have two rooms done for the price of the three and they told me ""no"" and that each room over 250 sqft counted as two rooms so I would have to pay the price for four rooms.  This makes zero sense to me since it would certainly be easier to clean two rooms (especially since they are connected) of just over 600 sqft than it would be to clean three separate rooms of the same square footage.  I don't appreciate the way they do business so I would definitely not recommend anyone call them.",1

this place is amazing! It's pure ingredients that they juice/blend right in front of you and the prices are probably the best in the city for juice. you pay $8.50 for 1 Liter. its because this is not a huge chain with the goal of maxing profit, but a really friendly couple who runs an honest business and will even pour the leftovers in a little cup for you to drink!",5

eeiOryvLMStOwNd6iwJYdA,"I shop at the Glendale and 35th Ave. store for produce only. The store is fairly new so it is large and clean, with a festive ambiance (very loud music, and the occasional dancing clowns). The produce is fresh and the prices are fantastic.

You can find things here that you can't get elsewhere, like Mexican papaya, every kind of chili pepper you can imagine, nopales cactus pads and other exotic items. 

On Weds and Thurs there are amazing sales and so the store gets quite crowded, so go early if you can. And be prepared to wait for awhile to check out. 

They also have a bakery, they make tortillas in-house and they have a salsa bar and a lunch counter with Mexican food that I haven't tried, but smells very good.

Different locations may have different quality of produce. I went to the location on Thomas and found great papayas but green bananas, then that same day I went to the one on Glendale and 35th Ave and found ripe bananas but bruised, past-their-prime  papayas.

I would not buy meat or fish here or anything else for that matter. Just produce. Be aware, it's all non-organic.

hmIjbkZxP87fYD_0Y2-IJQ,"WORST EXPERIENCE IN A RESTAURANT EVER.

I still cannot even believe what happened at the Grille on 8/9/16.
I dined with 3 friends on a warm evening and decided to sit on the patio. Hostess took us to our seats and when we were finally greeted by our waitress, she chastised us for sitting outside. She had an attitude right from the get-go, she clearly did not want to wait tables outdoors.  It was our first time at the Grille, so we had a lot of questions about the menu, portions, etc to which our waitress answered. Annoyed, but answered. Our drinks arrived a little delayed, delivered by a bartender. We were the only table outside and there were few cars in the lot, so we didn't imagine it would be busy. Service was slow enough you would have expected a full house.

Most of our food came out together, but of course delivered by someone other than our waitress. In the lull between ordering and delivery, the waitress never brought any condiments, napkins, silverware or anything. The food came and we had to wait to eat it because of this. My friends split a cheeseburger and there was nothing with it. No pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion... so friend asks waitress for at least some pickles. Waitress says haughtily 'well you could have had some pickles if you'd have asked for them!'. She arrives moments later with a plate of pickle spears.
My companions have all started eating and are nearly finished, but my food has not yet arrived. 6 lousy teriyaki wings. Then all of a sudden, a short angry man comes walking over with the wings and THAT'S WHEN SHIT WENT DOWN. He was yammering on about something then said 'Who has the wings?' when I replied he literally DROPPED the plate in front of me and said 'Here's your fuckin wings'. Our jaws hit the table once we realized he was not kidding around. He (THE OWNER!) was clearly upset over something he thought we said about fat, bald Greek men and was screaming and causing quite a commotion. He told us he didn't need us making all that noise in his restaurant and he didn't want people like us in his restaurant. Now he's walking around our table like a circling shark, he is clearly out of his GD MIND. 

I am certainly not going to touch the food he brought and now my husband is MAD so we ask for the check and get ready to leave. Angry guy says ""GET THE FUCK OUT. I own this place, I have plenty of money and don't need yours."" My girlfriend and I start walking out at this point. Other friend stops to ask the bartender for the check instead, but bartender just shakes his head and says 'He said not to....'  Husband asked people at the bar if we were being too loud and they all said ""No, he just goes off like that sometimes"".  Wait, so this is normal? And totally acceptable?

I would normally offer a fair review and comment on the taste of the food, prices, atmosphere, etc. But in this case, I couldn't care less what the rest had to offer. The food tasted like tears and bad business and the place looked like failure.
Not only will I never again patronize this establishment, I will go out of my way to tell people to never come here.

I have never been so insulted in all my life.

SamthzoFW2o4zDKLQ1zKBg,"Took our party of eight, including four kids, here on a Saturday afternoon.  There was already a 30 minute wait at 5:00PM, so it must be good.  

The first thing I noticed was that this place is loud, which is great when you have kids with you.  The service was very attentive and the input all orders directly into a mini-computer as you order.  This allowed our drinks to arrive at the table almost before we were done ordering.  

My wife and I both had burgers, which were excellent.  You can tell they spend time to get the best ingredients possible and the meat was cooked perfectly.  Our boys both wanted bratwurst and they were not fans.  The brats seemed to be overcooked and were dry.   The bread was also hard and dry.  This may be preferred by some, but for the kids, it was an issue.  We also ordered some fries, onion rings and a vanilla brean shake.  All were excellent.  

The only negative I can mention was that towards the end of the meal, we felt rushed to leave.  The check was already on our table by the time I took my 2nd bite and it seemed like our server was back to our table every two minutes asking if there was ""anything I can get out of your way.""  (Which I translated as ""can you please hurry up."") I know this place is popular and they want to turn tables quickly, but if I wait 30 minutes for a table and pay $12.00 for a burger, don't rush me.

After spending over 3k on a set of rims I'm beyond speechless!,1
NFC5vYud7D1aOlc8euURIw,"My 3 pound puppies get the best treatment from Dr. B & the staff at Durango Animal Hospital.  I have been so lucky to find a vet that truly cares about the animals he treats.  They'v also boarded at the hospital and I always know that they are in good hands.  If you are new in town, like I was a few years ago, or are just thinking about changing vets, you can't go wrong with Durango.",5
m0I6GYAGz9eod31L0v89Bg,I called these guys up to fix a little leak in my house.I knew exactly where the leak was and what I wanted fixed but when the guys came over they said the leak could be anywhere. I pointed out to him where it was and he said no it could be anywhere you have to replace all your pipes. Then he told me the charge would be $9500 so I told them no thanks and they charged me $50 for wasting my time.To make a long story short I called another plumber and he said your right the leak is right where you say it is and he fixed it in a few hrs for under 500. Please do yourself a favor and do not call these guys they are total scammers. I'm so disgusted with them that every time I hear there commercial on the radio I change the channel. Really they don't even deserve 1 star they should be shut down and thrown in jail for ripping people off because  I'm sure there is a lot of nice people out there that was ripped off by them I'm just  glad they only got me for $50!,1
2Re9-Gj0DGkCkbjTg6gthQ,"Our last visit gave us great service and excellent cocktails, but not as good food as in the past.  We had the bacon wrapped dates that were stuffed with blue cheese - the bacon was very, very well done.  Our favorite flatbread with filet and caramelized onions had way more mushrooms than filet, way more cheese than in the past and was underseasoned.  Remembering how this dish was always such a flavor explosion, I felt weird shaking salt and pepper on it.  The caesar salad with the lemon anchovy dressing, all tied up with a proscuitto ribbon, was outstanding.  I could've eaten 4 of those.  We've enjoyed La Cave so much in the past, the other dishes overshadowed the salad, making this visit disappointing.  La Cave's not at the top of our list anymore.",3
jzxdMtcapzyTime4HuGx_Q,"AMAZING!!! Totally recommend Sherene 100 times over!  She is amazing.  I got the Boss Brow microblading done... and got the brows I always dreamed of having.  I was really nervous about getting it done, because I don't really have any eyebrows. So I did a lot of research and found Sherene's work on Instagram, and was instantly impressed! Even better than her skill (which is amazing) is how much she cares.  I felt like my brows were as important to her as they were to me.  If you are thinking of having microblading done, your search is over... because you won't get better than Sherene!!!!!",5
1zjG_axXwG8P8rTVjAwicw,"The price ALWAYS changes when you return a car. I use business codes to get cars cheaper, and no matter what they always try to void them upon returning the car. they will also break contract and charge more than what you agree to pay. 

I recently had to pay an extra 100 dollars because the people at this location are clueless baboons that can't do anything for some reason. They supposedly have no power or ability to call a manager to fix any trouble you get at all. They just pretend you are stupid and make up extremely dumb excuses while ripping you off. 

I will never rent from Enterprise again. If you do, just be prepared when you come back to spend an extra 100-200 bucks. I came back to an added 600 dollars for my week rental, wasn't too thrilled about that one.....",1

Definitely worth a visit if you like Thai food.",4
cU6MwXeAqcNX2SoNGjG-VQ,"(Vegas Locals) My wife and I decided to try a different All-You-Can-Eat Korean barbecue and we were in for a surprise and pretty much ended up getting the worst customer service we've ever experienced. Dae Jang Keum (DJK) Korean barbecue at Spring Mountain is a 24/7 Korean BBQ who for what we know just added an ""AYCE"" option on their services. I'll just start this review with the PROS; first off their place is a bit spacious and seating/tables are huge and comfortable, secondly a few of the meat choices are USDA certified meat so you could guarantee the tenderness and juiciness of them and lastly is the fact that they're 24 hours and wait times are quick.
********************* But sadly, here are the CONS. As I mentioned this is an All You Can Eat restaurant and as most or all of us know that there are waitresses that takes your order and brings them to you. Well this waitress started off by greeting us with a frown on her face. Sure, I know that we're not Koreans and I understand that there might be a language barrier of some sort but the least you could do is try. My wife and I are not perfect but I could say that we treat others nicely and with utmost respect but that is far from what we got from them. This particular lady pushes our dishes away when she lays the other plates that we ordered and there are even times where she just pretty much almost just drops it on our table. Nearly everything that you request to her, she always have a *SIGH type of expression where she seems to get annoyed or she completely just doesn't care. After a while, we got tired of how she was treating us so we just asked another waitresses' help and surely that didn't help. This other lady kept on insisting that we have to finish a piece (literally 1 tiny baby octopus) before we could order anything else and she threatened us that we would have to pay for left overs (we're talking about a 2 1/2 inch baby octopus). My wife and I just looked at each other confused and wondering why are we being treated like this. So After finishing that we asked if we could order and she literally looked everywhere for that damn octopus and made sure we ate it. That was just flat out frustrating. Then she puts on a fake smile and sarcastically asked us what we want. Julie and Hailey were the the name badges that they were wearing (I'm sure those aren't there real names). I saw a total of 4 waitresses on our time there. I don't want to get the others in trouble, and I don't want to have to drop names as well but I'm left with no choice because I need protect the character of the other waitresses that we didn't have dealings with.
********************** Service in this place is TERRIBLE. Prices based on their menu (available meat choices/side dishes) are inflated and expensive compared to other similar restaurants. We also looked after receiving such horrible service in YELP to see how other's experiences went and you'll see how we weren't the only ones who complained. *********I DO NOT recommend this place at all and I guarantee that we would NEVER come back.*********

If you have any questions regarding the review or would like any other recommendations on where to go, please feel free and shoot me a message and I would gladly point you to the right direction. Thanks !",1

E5H_WhrY2vw9YkpDtrEh7Q,"I've been to Postino a few times, but as we all know it is a violation of Yelp TOS to review an establishment until you've been drunk there. What? It's not? Well, I would consider it in poor taste.

I got drunk at Postino last night and had a wonderful time. The $20 Bruschetta Board and Bottle of Wine promotion they have Mondays and Tuesdays is a ridiculous steal. I didn't want to be the alcey to ask if that deal was limited to one-per-table as I was fully planning on consuming my own bottle of wine and possibly my own board of bruschetta. Luckily the guys across the bar had the same plan, so I didn't have to. FYI: It is illegal for restaurants to serve you your own bottle of wine. Don't ask how I know. I just know. However, you can split 3 or 4 with one other person and nobody says anything. Don't ask how I know this either. I just know. 

All of the different bruschetta options are fantastic. The Prosciutto one tasted like Cinnamon Toast to me. That may have been the booze talking. Considering I kept referring to it as ""Cinnamon Toast Crunch"", I'm going to go ahead and say it was. The roasted red pepper & goat cheese and the apple & brie were equally delicious. Sorry, I don't have a breakfast cereal comparison for them. 

To top it off, the service is fan-freaking-tastic. Everyone is extremely helpful and seems genuinely HAPPY  that you are there spending money. Clearly, from a business standpoint, this should be a given, but more often than not it isn't. Once I was there with a girl whose recently adopted Greyhound was somehow prompted to dart across the patio like a bat out of hell, knocking over chairs and wine glasses along the way. Not only was the staff RIDICULOUSLY nice about it, a few of the valet guys actually CHASED AFTER this greyhound and I'm pretty sure one of them got into his car to find it. The staff literally organized an impromptu search party for a dog that could run upwards of 60 MPH. That is some damn good service. And, we found the dog.",5
uuo0iRC97pmCwuCVU9vikA,"After years of visiting this place, I still only come for one thing...Five O'Clock Somewhere cocktails. This was the very first drink I purchased in Vegas when I became legal to drink and I've been ordering it ever since. I stop in for one whenever I'm in Vegas or at least try to. I enjoy the flavor despite it somewhat having the flavor of grapefruit. The cocktail also has a good amount of rum for Bacardi 151 fans.

I don't order much food here but if I were to call off any from the top of my head that I believe is worth ordering, it would be the seafood mac n cheese (formally lobster mac) and would have been the teriyaki steak that's no longer on the menu. I use to enjoy the steak that had the flavor of pineapple and do enjoy the mac n cheese that has a creamy cheese and crab flavor. All other entrees I've tried has been just ok, nothing to write home about. 

I've visited when it's been sort of dead and other's when it's completely live. The dead times were usually on random week day's when the Vegas strip isn't busy. Nevertheless, there's always good music playing and it's always fun to watch people get up and dance. Especially when they've had one too many drinks.

Five O'Clock Somewhere is my go to here and I'm happy it can still pack a punch year after year since my first time having it eleven years ago.

DF8xRKS4gXv0qRq5sWQ-Pw,"MAC is my go-to place for makeup.  Their product is superb and there are literally infinite ways to use the line.  The makeup artists are required to go to school for a year or so before they can work there; they know the qualities of their inventory inside and out.  The individuals working here are always very colorful and creative with their own makeup.  

Sometimes it's tricky to get assistance, but if you're persistent you'll receive service relatively quickly.  Beware, these stores can be packed!  I've had my makeup done by MAC artists at other locations, and the results are usually stunning.  Of course, not all makeup artists' visions align with one's own, so be sure to speak up about what you have in mind!  

Any artist prizes their tools because they can make or break a look.I use MAC brushes exclusively; the quality is absolutely exceptional and they last for YEARS.  Ask a MAC artist to help you select the essential brushes--they make all the difference in the world when it comes to applying makeup.  It's an investment that you won't regret.  Trust me.  Buy the brush cleaner as well.  There's nothing worse than getting a nasty eye infection due to a germ-infested eyeliner brush. 

I'm also a loyal customer because of Back 2 Mac--their recycling program--bring in 6 empty containers to a MAC store (not a department store counter) and you'll receive an eyeshadow, lipstick or lip gloss of your choice.",4

Service is poor, prices are super high, and they have no clue how to cook meat.  Last two times everything comes out rare, regardless of what you order.  I always order medium well, last two times the meat is pretty much purple/red inside.  Sent it back both times and they returned with charred bits.  The second time I asked to speak with a manager, after expressing my displeasure with the porterhouse and he said that my party had eaten enough (roughly 2 pieces between 3 people ~10-15%) to be charged and they would do nothing about it on the bill.  In my 30 years of eating out, I have never felt compelled to not leave a tip.  I not only left no tip, but the remainder of the destroyed porterhouse.  Don't mind overpaying for a quality meal/experience, but Carnevino is not worth the hassle.  Give me a break Mario.",1

KnrilTjPQLogBH4Iq8cjqg,"Tree Country Bistro is in the space that used to hold Que Tal.

Quickly they have turned the room into an Asian, Japanese, Korean, and Thai restaurant. The room is very similar to the layout that once was Que Tal. The sushi chef is now in the space where people prepared your meal before. The tables are the same making for a casual atmosphere. No booths or romantic spaces, but still comfortable. 

The menu is huge. Lots of sushi! Curries, noodles, all kinds of dishes.
We're both vegetarian so we got #501 Veggie Lover Maki. For $12.95 we got like 40 rolls in 3 different varieties. They were SUPERB! Hats off to the chef (whom was kind as well) and placed the rolls into a heart formation on both our dishes with a carrot butterfly and swan happily in the middle. Presentation was a knockout! The avocado was super flavorful, the veggies crisp and mouth watering and one of the particular rolls had a completely unique flavor that was leaving us wondering who thought this greatness up?!

The dishes also came with a vegetarian soup and salad which was just as tasty. The dressing is yumness. One other cool thing was the rolled and sealed hand towel that you get upon ordering. This is common in Japan but I personally haven't seen it in the US other than on planes (mind you these are not hot.) 

The service was kind and attentive. The employees were very friendly and the chef was equally eager to see that we enjoyed our food.
I love this place thus far and plan to come back again very soon...my husband is already wanting more!",5

dAP_HIdCuEl0DwFxM-X_VQ,"I came here upon the referral of a good friend who had INCREDIBLE nail designs all of the time. Lien is the SH*T!

To begin with, I was a bit early and Lien was right there ready for me. She got right to business, asking what ideas I had in mind- when I told her 4th of July, so was so excited! No one had asked for 4th of July yet (come on people, by a patriot!!). I showed her some ideas off of Pinterest, and there was nothing she couldn't do. 

Lien spent about 2 hours on just my manicure, and while it could have been because it was a slow Tuesday, I think it was because she really just wanted to take her time and do things right. She gave me a great shape on my nails, trimmed my cuticles perfectly and got to work on the polish. It is obvious she takes great pride in her work, because she constantly stopped to check to make sure everything was perfect. Lien worked incredibly hard on my nails, and I still can not believe how cool they turned out!

I have a manicurist already that I will be returning to wen I get a normal mani/pedi, but whenever I want nail designs, I will definitely be coming to see Lien! 

-Only downside was the price. $45 for a gel mani with designs. However, she literally painted a masterpiece on my nails, so I think it was totally worth it! Thanks Lien!!",5

KTGzohn9nO-jyz_sIMjB2g,"Anyone who gave the Hard Rock under 3 stars is either an idiot or an old fart who just didn't get it.

I recently had an epiphany: the ONLY place to stay in Vegas is the Hard Rock.  I don't care what anyone else has to say about it.  All of those other big time casinos are too huge, desensitized, impersonal and just plain suck to stay at.  I like the fact that I recognize certain employees at the Hard Rock- and they recognize and are friendly to me as well.  Those huge mega casinos are fun to visit for a club or restaurant, but staying at them is like getting lost in the mall of america.  Senior citizens and screaming children running up and down the hallways- uh, yea...NO THANK YOU.  Kids shouldn't even be allowed in Vegas in the first place.

The Hard Rock is so fun, young, edgy, hip, beautiful, has great music and the best all-around party scene in Vegas.  The only other casino that can compete is the Palms, but I still think HR is better because its just so much cooler.  It has great restaurants and great entertainment.  AND, its only going to get better with the expansion.  Body English is arguably the best club in Vegas and Rehab is definitely the best summertime party for sure.  The Hard Rock Store carries quality items that I'd actually want to buy outside of Vegas- not the cheap ""Las Vegas"" crap merchandise or Celine Dion memorabilia- I'm talking cute clothes, great designers and nice jewelry.

Not to mention the rooms!  Their beds are so comfortable.  And the rooms are decorated well- not cheesy with crappy generic furniture and floral wallpaper.  They're in the process of expanding the hotel so the construction noise does suck, but you should be too drunk/hungover to be bothered by that anyways, right?!  And, we must all pay some price for improvement....I just hope that the expansion doesn't take away the great vibe the hard rock has now. 

Oh, cant wait to go back on opening day of Rehab...I'd move into the Hard Rock if I could.",5

There isn't a bad seat in the stadium, and although it's an older stadium, my only real complaint was the exorbitant prices. The lawn seats prices were double that of the seats behind home plate for the Giants vs. Brewers games at the Maryvale Stadium! Don't the Giants make enough money off of their fans in the regular season? It would be nice if they had lower prices for their spring training games, especially since a lot of fans are already spending a lot of money traveling.

Given the time of the year it was acceptable  Food was good for a mass order.  Dessert was excellent. Beer and cocktail selection was also above average as they carry a number of imports that they'll include in the private bar (delerium, leffe, etc).

When I dropped off my phone intially it was with a female who was REALLY REALLY UNFRIENDLY which also knocked off some stars..when I went to pick up my phone a different guy was there a younger one and he was friendly but he handed me back my phone and it had looked like my back plate was messed up when I quested him about it he said that was my case..I was like ""No my case is green and a full body case"" He went to search for it and said whoops we must of given it to the wrong person. That was upsetting but I didn't have the energy to argue with them or deal with trying to get a credit. So essentially they give decent prices and get the job done but they are not the friendliest or most reliable.. I would ONLY recommend them if you are in the area..also keep in mind its CASH ONLY and comes off somewhat shady...",2

5 stars! Intercom is fixed and I could clearly hear and understand everything and 0608 in the morning and they are up and running. Didn't ask for military discount and checked my check, sure enough, good to go. Great job to the owners and staff for taking care of the customer!  Just showing you care enough to try is more than most these days, great business!

Update: I wrote a review a few days ago about some issues I felt could improve at this location. I noticed that the business itself comments back on many of the Yelp reviews. Within a couple days, the business has already put plans in place to enhance the service at this location and that automatically bumps it up a star. Kudos to you for running a business you care about!  Heading over this morning hoping they are open.

Tropical smoothie is delicious and I will be a long-term customer.  Thanks!",5
Uhf5BJdauqxL-3kjEcdVYw,"The reviews on this place seem very unfair! We came during prime dinner hour on Sunday. There was a wait for seating inside but opted for immediate seating on the patio. Service was swift and our waitress was VERY friendly. 
 My boyfriend ordered the mozzarella squares. I had a bite and they were very good! The breading was a bit thick but the mozzarella was hot and stringy (like it should be) and the marinara was unexpectedly tasty. The cornbread bites were okay but nothing special. We split the MVP- 1/2 smoked chicken, pulled pork, brisket, St. Louis and baby back ribs. The portion sizes were HUGE! We have two boxes of leftovers! Here's the breakdown-
Brisket: nice smoke ring, nice smoke flavor, tender but a tad overly fatty
Pulled pork: great tasting, dry in some spots but overall tender, pronounced smoke flavor
Chicken: mild smoke, no real smoke ring, breast a bit dry but thigh very juicy
St. Louis ribs: tad tough, over sauced, great smoke flavor, thick smoke ring, awesome crust
Baby back ribs: perfectly sauced, great crust, great smoke flavor but the pork flavor came through, tender and fall off the bone
Overall a great and well worth it meal. Next time I'm sticking to the baby back ribs though! They're, in my opinion, the best locally. The sauce is really delicious too! A must try!",4

MQaIro8weJjThRK6-vUywA,"With 18 unique brews on tap, this place is truly a gem and has probably the best selection of beer variety in all of Montreal. Came on a Sunday night and the entire place was packed. We waited ~45 mins for our seats, then proceeded to taste about 10-12 of the beers on the menu.

Some of the highlights included Menthalite, which was a stout brewed with mint and bourbon. Passion Houblon, a passion fruit IPA, and my personal favorite of the night, the Isseki Nicho, which is a hybrid of an imperial stout and saison that really has a myriad of flavors.

Prices were also incredibly fair: a tasting of 12 or so beers for the three of us (with snacks) came out to under $40, which is pretty incredible. Didn't have a chance to try the food here other than chips and salsa, but they also looked promising.

Stop by and taste the entire beer menu, if you dare.",5

Honestly I'm so shocked that they can keep prices this low!!! The owner was super nice and friendly and it was only a 5 minute wait for the set.  

The chocolate on the crepe wasn't your standard nutella, but it tasted like actual chocolate.  The crepe itself was just ok though, but definitely worth the money.  

There are many other items on the menu well worth trying!",4
FXWVYAHM4ZbTp9Sq4TmTwQ,"a friend took me here because she heard through friends that it was good.

it is good.

the deer carpaccio is amazing, fresh meat well accompanied with a special mayo sauce and balsamic vinegar, and fried onions sprinkled on top, nice very nice.

the mackerel is nice too, surprisingly, i usually don't like mackerel cuz it's smelly, but this dish has bacon bits in it and the sauce has honey  i think so the sweetness adds a nice touch.

The gnocchi is so very good, just as good as Il Mulino, and that's as good as it gets. It's made fresh, it's soft and just melts in your mouth, the sauce is a bit creamy but not rich, but smooth and well balanced. With a touch of parmesan and crushed pepper and suddenly the last bite is up and you wondered how you inhaled the whole thing so quickly...

The seared foie gras with balsamic vinegar was nice too. But we're in montreal and foie gras is done well everywhere... this one was good but it doesn't stand out that's all, but it was very good.

At first glance this place reminds me of au pied de cochon, open kitchen eating bar concept. the ambiance is similar But the food is different.

all in all this is was a wonderful surprise, on the strength of the mackerel, carpaccio and gnocchi. the price is decent about 130$ tax tips included for two, two entrées, two main dishes, two desserts and one glass of wine.

This and Kazu, are my new favorite restaurants of 2010",4

Highlights: 
--gym was nice and had enough stuff to keep me fit during the weekend, but didn't have bottled water (instead there was a filter machine with water that still strangely tasted like tap...)
-- saw Lisa Ling here when we checked in (a little celebrity endorsement never hurts)
-- the mini kitchen was great! When we weren't fine dining, we brought back sandwiches for late night snacks and it was nice to be able to store them in the fridge and also be able to boil water for tea.
-- ordered in-suite dining: we had two fresh atlantic salmons with buttered mashed potatoes and broccolini... it was SERIOUSLY TO DIE FOR.... SOOO DELICIOUS. The hotel staff who brought it was also really friendly and chatty while he set up our living table for us with our dinner. They even included a pat of room-temp butter and two brioche buns (which were actually stale, but it's the thought that counts).
-- bathtub was ginormous, and had a jacuzzi in it!! 
-- I also liked that it was kind of off the strip but was a very easy walk over to the Wynn. Also, no casino = no cigarette smoke = easy-breathing for my lungs!


Lowlights:
-- There's a train that honks every single time it brings freight through... I totally understand and support safety... but SERIOUSLY, it's 3am and a girl's trying to get her beauty sleep! Pleeeease, stop blaring your horn!!!
-- Service was spotty... they kept forgetting to restock our water, and we had to ask for housekeeping every afternoon even though our housekeeping button was lit.
-- Where was our upgrade??
-- 4pm checkout was great... until a hotel employee actually keyed into our room at 3pm to ""check if we were still there."" Um... can you say privacy breach?",3

We were told it would be a few minutes and as soon as a table opened up we would be seated. But I made a reservation....doesn't that mean a table should be ""reserved"" for us???  After about a fifteen minute wait, and another party being seated ahead of us who had just walked in, we finally got seated. 

The food was good, although I found the condiments served with the fajitas a bit stingy, I had to ask for extra salsa. Our server was efficient, and friendly enough I guess. We did enjoy the free chips and salsa. I don't know if the Tex mex food is that much better than anywhere else I've eaten, but my kids really like the Mac n cheese bites.

oRvI9Djh7--QXV-SIcSU6g,"I've been to Canadian Thai a few times, and it's definitely best for lunch. Their specials are comparatively priced and provide quite a fair amount of food and rather quickly, making an ideal lunch for those who need to get back to work quickly.

The food is above average, although I've yet to be impressed by any of their appetizers. The menu also includes a number of Chinese dishes (big surprise). Soups are run-of-the-mill and are nothing special. Mains are of a few basic but tasty varieties and are usually pretty good while coming with a layer of added oil.
I haven't tried much of the Chinese food, as the Thai is solid and is usually what comes with lunch and what I go here for. Just an FYI- crispy on the menu = deep fried.

Service here is above average, probably since the place isn't large enough for the wait staff not to be able to see everything going on from any single vantage point. Staff is pleasant and offers to help with the menu despite its simplicity.

Good for an introduction to some of the more basic Thai dishes or as a staple quick lunch. 3-3.5/5.",3

The hash house has a good breakfast, but it stops there. The hotel as a whole was dirty. We stayed on the 11th floor and every room we passed to get to ours was missing the numbers on there door. Our carpet was pulled up and shredded in our room, our sink wouldn't drain and left us forced to use water from the shower and you could hear the guests next door breath. After check out we went to hash house and then sat in the lobby while we waited for an uber. The security guard accused my fiancé of ""sleeping"" in the lobby just because his hat was low to help with the brightness of the lights. It's Vegas, hangovers are to be expected. We got up and sat outside to wait for an uber. The security guard approached us again and proceeded to tell us we need to go. I let him know that we stayed here for two nights, spend plenty of money at their casino and their dining. He walked back inside and came out with two more security guards. I proceeded to inform them of what happened and they were slightly more reasonable. The first security guard continued to talk under his breath.

Two people ordered steaks and the other two had burgers (burgers were huge!). Everyone enjoyed their meals and said they would come back. I love that they give you warm bread to start.

SxxaPb4n2IZ1OjWvBfH4dA,"Well, what can I say.  Flemings is a chain steakhouse, but they do try hard.  Sometimes a bit too hard.  You know you're at a chain from the quality of service.  Don't get me wrong, the service is very nice most of the time, but it's clear they do peppy training seminars catering to midwestern diners and the whole thing comes off a bit like TGI Fridays.  Once in awhile servers there are not the friendliest; they seem to have a hard time taking a moderate line of just being courteous and efficient.

English translation:  Oh my love, why have you kept me waiting?  Gelato has come to me!  Oh and with so many different flavors of chocolate!  How can I decide my love?  You tempt me!

SNAP OUT OF IT!  Ok well we went in there just at closing time which I thought was 10:00 pm but my boyfriend noticed the door said 9:30 pm but it was too late, I was already ""in the zone"" and looking over the many chocolate flavor combinations of gelato.  With my eyes glazing over, I asked the lady behind the counter for a few taste samples so I could make my most difficult decision of the day, which chocolate flavor do I want?  When I asked for the third taste, she informed me that you only get two taste samples.  WHAT?  You have this beautiful store with these fabulous gelatos and you lay out this beautiful and tempting display and you only get two samples?  Really?  I was able to get another taste sample out of her but it was clear she was tired and they wanted us to hurry up with our selection so they could close.  I still didn't understand her attitude as I didn't notice the time change of closing at 9:30 pm.  So I guess I can understand her attitude, knowing that now.  However, it seems to me that if you decide to accept serving a customer then allow them to complete their purchase in the normal manner.  We took our selections to go, so it's not like we were staying inside the restaurant at closing.

WHAT ABOUT THE GELATO????  Ok so let's get down to the real reason for our visit.  We shared Pistachio-such a diversion to my purist chocolate affinity.  Wonderful pistachio, you can taste the fresh nuts in the mix.  We both got medium sized gelatos with two flavors to sample.  I ordered the GERMAN CHOCOLATE and you can taste and feel many textures in your mouth with the shredded coconut and chunks of dark chocolate.  On top of that, I used my third sample taste which was ROCKY ROAD and that one had the marshmallow and chocolate swirled into the mix.  Both flavors were very rich, thick, creamy and filling.  It was so satisfying.  I know that next time, however I will get a small cup as it is more filling than ordinary ice cream, to me and it is so decadent.  

There wasn't time to get the owner's story or about their gelato or how much sugar and butterfat they use in their recipes.  Next time I visit I will look into that.  However on the whole, if you have to ask, you probably don't need to be eating it anyway.  

Just enjoy the wonderful taste experience and the beautiful, modern store.  It is located in Boca Park between Wendy's and Tilly's and in the same building as Wahoo's Fish Taco and Jason's Deli.

BWsnir8M-e1w2LkxdeqzYA,"I had heard about Savoy for years. About how beautiful the space was and how expensive the food was but, I had never went for dinner. I had tasted Savoy's food before at the Pittsburgh Magazines Best Restaurants Party multiple times and at the Yelp Tech Shop Event and at the Yelp's Soirée @ Savoy Elite event. Each time the food was very good.

I saw a $49 Groupon Deal for Savoy that I couldn't pass up that included two entrees and one dessert of your choice. I decided to check them out for a date night with my wife Tamika so we could finally see what all the fuss was about. 

Now let me tell you about the space. All I can say is WOW! It is absolutely beautiful. Savoy has to be one of the most beautiful spaces in Pittsburgh. Once inside you fill like you've been transported to Atlanta, New York or Miami. It was created by Pittsburgh designer Luca Paganico and transformed an dated three story building into a posh and intimate restaurant with leather couches and chairs, a fiber optic bar, and walls with lighting that changes color as patrons dine. Upstairs in the lounge area was just as beautiful. With four separate sectional couch areas with TVs on the wall. I know it had to cost a fortune to build and furnish the space.

We started off with drinks. I had the Peach on Peach and the Mrs. had the Blueberry Mojito. The drinks took a while to reach the table but, once they did they were worth the wait.

Next we enjoyed a complementary bread basket with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. It was very good followed by an amazing lemon sorbet to cleanse our palates.

For our entrees I had the N.Y. Strip Steak with compressed mushrooms, Yukon whipped potatoes and haricots verts. The streak was cooked perfectly and just how I asked for it to be cooked. My only complaint is that the sauce for the streak was extremely salty. Also like when the salt was added the top was loose and salt got dumped onto my plate. 

My wife had the Pork Chops which was one of the dinner features that night. Her pork chops were even more salty then my steak so she only ate about a quarter of it and took the rest home. Savoy does offer quite a few Gluten Free dining options as well

For dessert we shared the salted carmel chocolate torte. (Roasted banana ice cream, milk chocolate cashew bark and chocolate fondue) It was even chosen as Savor Pittsburgh's Dish of the Year for 2013. IT WAS AMAZING! 

Service was superb the entire evening. I also like the fact that you can make reservations right from the Savoy website which are a must as the space only seats about 75 people.

All in all Savoy is a nice place that I would visit for sure for drinks during Happy Hour and go somewhere else for dinner. I just cannot with a clear conscience justify the prices without a Groupon Deal.",4
msdW7D8mAGjryz64GFmr8g,"I came to Yelp when we discovered termite tunnels, I also had 3 other quotes and did some research with the BBB, also compared Yelp reviews with other companies...and like everyone has said - we had fast and friendly service!
And very affordable!

I had hoped for a longer warranty - and getting around that by paying an annual fee - but the lower price up front helps justify the annual fee you pay to keep up the warranty.

At the very least I would have hoped for a 3 year warranty.  But I suppose they would increase their price to cover that cost, since most other companies offer 3-5 year warranties.",5

Our stay here was convenient to the city and the hotel was well managed and orderly. I think the character of this hotel changes when the baseball team is in town for a game. With the team on a road trip away from town, our stay was pleasant at the Springhill.

http://www.diopitt.org/archives/St.%20Mary%20of%20Mercy%20Photos%20Page.htm

St. Mary of Mercy, Downtown Pittsburgh

St. Mary of Mercy was founded in 1870.  Two years prior to that a house was purchased in September 1868 and converted as a chapel called Our Lady of Consolation for the Irish residents of the Point area.  At first this chapel served as a mission for St. Paul Cathedral, but in 1870 St. Mary was formed as an independent parish.  This building soon became inadequate for the growing congregation.  On May 12, 1876, the Ames Methodist Episcopal Church on the corner of Third Avenue and Ferry Street was purchased by the parish.  After renovation, the church was dedicated on September 24, 1876 and renamed St. Mary of Mercy.  

Even this church proved inadequate, so in 1893 a new church was built and dedicated on May 28, 1893 on the site of the current church.  For forty years, this church served the congregation well.  However, by the early 1930's, structural damage and the small size of the building necessitated the building of a new church.  The last Mass in this church was held on May 22, 1935.  The church was then razed and the current building constructed at the same location.  On October 25, 1936, the existing St. Mary of Mercy, located at the corner of Stanwix Street and the Boulevard of the Allies was dedicated.  This church is still in use today.",4

BC9Rjsb5pTDbJKhFxKCRug,"Nick's happens to be a few doors down from my business... very dangerous!! Literally, everything is so good. They bake their bread fresh everyday and it melts in your mouth.

Lunch - I suggest a sandwich on their french bread. I personally love their hot chicken sandwich with balsalmic dressing, melted cheese and seasoned chicken, grilled onions... need I go on - hmmm I'm hungry. 
or the greek salad with sliced chicken...

Dinner- This is where you eat the foccacia bread. Now when you're dieting and not allowed carbs - just eat the tops & save your cheat calories for the chicken marsala with penne pasta. 

Don't forget dessert - The tiramisu.

Enjoy",5

WAY overpriced drinks and food.

I ordered a turkey avocado sandwich, but they forgot the avocado. It was even written on the box and still missed it. The last two times we ordered carry out, there was little more than a handful of fries in the box. I thought the first time was a fluke. But it was the same the second time for me.

sUnS8h4IbRAZy4f6yxD9Vw,"My family had a great time at Cowabunga Bay water park yesterday!! It was our first visit. The rides were a lot of fun, the wave pool was awesome, and the cleanliness and staff service stood out. We're from Washington and we had a somewhat unpleasant experience last summer when we visited a well-advertised Raging Waters park near Los Angeles.
The zuma-zooma slide was unbelievable! I've never been on a slide like it - it was fast all the way to the finish after the initial floor drop. My family also really enjoyed the big drop & pendulum action of the Wild Surf slide. We also loved the wave pool, which had steady large waves (we all felt like we were surfing!) and didn't wait too long between the wave action - Wild Waves park in WA makes you wait probably 20-30 minutes between waves.
The park was also very well-maintained. The staff had something to do with this, as they were friendly, responsive, and thorough. It was evident that safety is a priority at the park. The food was also reasonably priced and tasty - I enjoyed my barbecue beef sandwich :)
If we're ever in Las Vegas again, we'll look forward to another visit to Cowabunga Bay!!",5

Adventurous, we even tried the grilled leek: too fibrous to my taste, it was hard to eat but interesting way of eating it nevertheless. My favorite was the lamb skewers: well seasoned, properly spiced, and with good textured meat at $2 a skewer. I think the same spices are applied to all of their BBQ. This is my kind of treat: à la carte ordering and good variety. Tea is served as with all Chinese restaurants and it's cash only.",4

v9Y7cJ6ueJiLHhAfIYQ9XQ,"Remember Twin Peaks?  If David Lynch owned a shorefront bar in Quebec this would be the one.

Willow Inn claims to be more than 100 years old, though only the fireplace dates from before the mid-1960s.  Decor is pretty ""rural Canada bar"" style, except for the gorgeous view of the Ottawa river and the Oka ferry going back and forth (back and forth, etc.).  They also have a lawn/terrace where you can have drinks but no food.

Hudson is a charming town about halfway between Ottawa and Montreal.   Even if you've never been there you've seen it before times.  It is often the location for tv shows and movies that purport to be set in small town New England.  

The customers at the Willow are just, well, quirky.  Like a lot of failed reality show performers got together in one place to drink and dine.  (Think of Dog the Bounty Hunter, his lovely wife Beth, any Jersey Shore cast member, and the touring cast of Bon Cop, Bad Cop.)   Downtown Hudson tends to be a lot more buttoned-down.  Out here on the fringes, no so much.

Some of the appeal might be the weekend wine deal? (Liquor store cost plus $5 per bottle).

So enough snobbery.  The food was really good.  The french fries were excellent (and this is perhaps the toughest pommes frites crowd in the world outside of Belgium). I had a carrot cheddar soup that sounds weird but was weird in a delicious way... and the burger was really, really excellent -- thick, juicy and a perfect 10.",4

After walking in at around 9pm on a weeknight, we waited 10 minutes before we were even greeted by a waitress. When she finally approached us, she said a huge crowd just came in, so the wait would be very very long. I pointed out a table for two that was open in the corner of the restaurant and she begrudgingly said we could sit there and that she would be by in a few minutes to wipe the table down.
After another 20 minutes of waiting patiently, the manager came to our table to tell us to move seats so another customer could squeeze into the already tight space. She made no comments or efforts regarding our filthy table, or the fact that we didn't even have a menu.

At that point, we decided to leave the restaurant and take our business elsewhere.

Fuku Burger delivered all this and more, with the topper being a Japanese-inspired joint that spoke volumes to my nerdy anime-loving soul. Walking in, the walls are decorated with rectangular Japanese portraits that are reminiscent of Gwen Stefani's ""Harajuku Lovers"" series. The menu was simple to read, understand, and to select food from. The Kinoko burger with mushrooms and pickled red ginger was juicy with the right amount of tangy crunch--and gone quickly, as it was excellent. The fries with the accompaniments of their notorious ""crack"" sauce and sweet ketchup were perfectly seasoned and I couldn't get enough of them. Above all this, the staff, led by Elise and Marcus, were wonderful to chat with and made sure this Midwestern man was welcomed. And, I was. I love restaurants that focus on keeping it simple, and this one made me feel right at home. I highly recommend Fuku to anyone, and I hope many will spring up in Chicago and abroad.

You order food as you see them come around on carts, flagging down workers and picking however many dishes you want from the cart. They will mark down the types of dishes you got, which will add to your total. Different carts have different items, but the same carts will come around quite often.

We ordered a few dishes, all containing lamb. The ones that I remember:
-lamb soup: I didn't like this one actually. Seemed like they added some flavor to try to mask the gaminess, but I didn't really like that flavor. When I order a lamb product, I want the gaminess! 
-lamb dumplings were excellent. Among the best that I've had
-had a lamb noodle dish that was the special of the day. This was also really good. Probably our favorite dish of the night
-stay away from the lamb chops! They were really salty, and also a LOT of fat pieces (in fact, there was more fat than meat)

Located next to Frys on Rural and Ray.  We frequent takeout more often then dine-in. They have reserved spaces and a special door for takeout which makes it very handy.  

If you dine in it is casual and very hip. Well decorated, trendy lights, lots of tables, booths and a bar area to the left.  

Look for coupons in the Wednesday mail.  Altbough, the prices are very reasonable.  Complimentary wRm bread and olive oil is a great start.

My dear wife likes the chalkboard menu. The chalkboard menu is an assortment of different dishes and your choice of meat.  The roasted asparagus salad with chicken is a favorite.  

The kids calzones are amazing and enormous. The choice for kids is pepperoni or cheese.  The adult calzone is enormous and wonderful as well they have a special which has pepperoni mushroom and sausage. Big enough for two meals.  

If you get takeout ask for extra marinara for the calzones. Also with takeout complimentary bread is provided which is a nice touch. They even have a small container for the olive oil balsamic dipping sauce.

It is my first time at Fuku-Tea and I came to this place after I had dinner on my first dating anniversary and they managed to ruin the whole joy of the night.

I ordered a mango-guava bubble tea with ""light sweetness"" (as they call it on the menu). Since I dislike super-sweet stuff, I am very peculiar to have my drinks lightly sweetened.

After getting the order and having a sip, since it was too sweet, I asked one of the employee to change it and she refused to do so. She said the syrups are already sweet and that is why the whole thing was too sweet. So watch out if you have diabetes cause you their unsweetened tea would give you a sugar rush!

I asked for the manager and they just consulted with somebody behind the wall and got back to me that NO they can't change the drink. 

Considering that I only had a sip and considering the cheap price of a bubble-tea it is such a disappointment that they made a big deal out of it. I am not gonna even elaborate on their attitude as that was another story for itself. This was definitely my last visit.",1

rdWn8iANq2O_diOPXcDGrQ,"I like Uncle Sam's. I went to college in the area and now work in Oakland so I have been a frequent customer over the past decade or so. 

Let's start with the extras. Their fries are amazing but so oily I often feel like I'm hardening an artery as I eat them but they are so good I reckon it's OK to have them once in a while (as long as you split an order). They also have a fried onion thing that is kind of like an onion ring, only not ring shaped, they are also very good. 

Beer selection:  I am unsure if the Oakland Uncle Sam's has beer. I live in the Robinson area so we usually go to the Robinson US for dinner (aka beer time). Their beer selection is pretty good considering it's a sandwich shop not a bar. We usually split a six pack for our group of 4 and the price is reasonable as well. 

Subs: I usually get the cheese steak with onions and pepper. I think it's pretty good. They cook them right there in front of you so at least it is freshly made. I have found that if you go here during lunch or dinner more often than not they burn your steak. This is a recent development and only happens at the Oakland location.  This is the only reason I'm giving this review 3 stars instead of 4. I like a hot dog charred but not a cheese steak. The bread here is really good. I think it is Mancini's but I've never asked. I was a vegetarian for many many years but have never tried one of US veggie subs. They cook their veggies and their meat on the same surface so if you are a strict vegetarian who doesn't want your veggies contaminated by cooking on the same surface as meat this is not the  place for you. I just don't understand this because they have a ton of vegetarian options that all sound great but then they cook them on a meat cooked surface. So beware if you want a truly vegetarian meal! 

Parking: Parking is mostly street parking. There is a parking garage not far from here but the price to park in the garage is a bit steep and during work hours it can be hard to find a spot in the garage to begin with! Your best bet is street parking but if you can't parallel park you're pretty much out of luck. 

There isn't much space to die in so you're better off getting your meal to go and walking over the Schenley Plaza and getting a table and having your lunch out of doors. I say it's worth a trip but not a trip out of your way!",3

Vr48J-7N_ioCtKnC5jE6Gw,"Location: Very accessible by subway. About 5-10 minute walk from Finch station.

Price: Drinks are all around $5-7 each.

Food: my most personal favourite at this place is the milk foam! It's a unique combination of sweet and salty (strange, but delicious!) I didn't realize the magic taste of salted crema until I find this place! The foam is slightly heavy so it goes well with a light, slightly sweet drink. The wintermelon tea with milk foam was amazing! I was slightly sceptical about veggies in my drink but I'm sold!

Seating: they have about 3 huge tables so it's good for huge groups. They also have free WiFi so people sometimes sit and study.

Overall: Nice place for foamy tea and large/small groups!",5

nd2LmcsI4n2gaqQ_wefTag,"Cute interior, tasty jerk chicken.  This small little restaurant serves up big portions of hearty Caribbean foods with very friendly service.  My only nit-picky thing was that the chicken, while tasty, did have a little too much salt for my tastes.",4
UFKzQa1MvBt3WD-ZJDJ1-A,"This weekends stop on our pick a spot.

The decor of this place is nice, just what you would expect from a nice bar.  Wood bar, warm environment, lots of tv's, kitchy art up on the walls... the norm.  That being said my wife and I ordered an appetizer, a meal each, and some wings (the menu leads you to believe that these things are to die for).  

Just for those who will go there in the future, there are other ways to do nachos besides throwing a bunch of chips on a plate then pilling onions, olives, jalapeños, and cheese all over them.  If your going to feature something and suggest it to new comers to your restaurant, you may want to make it something rememberable.  

The meals were just straight bland.  My wife had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich (which it was nice to see it was a butterflied piece of chicken breast, i.e. fresh) and I had there Stacker (panini).  My wife's' food was fine, nothing special.  The only problem was that the coleslaw was so wet that it was dripping liquified mayonnaise onto the bun, the breading, everything.  Unfortunately mine was as well.  Wet, soggy italian bread soaked in liquid mayo... enough said.  The wings were just wings.  Fried, sauced, and served.  

If your looking for something different from a bar, you won't find it here.  Run of the mill bar.  Oh and lastly, for a bar... or tavern... 5 beers on tap and only one beer that was from the local brewery?  You would think there would be more in that realm.",2
M6HB1PiRY0BtSm6p5khpzA,"T bones!
Another Resturant that I've been visiting for about 10 years. I'm going keep this short and sweet.

Let's start with the good:
Great place for eating ANYTIME of the day as it's 24/7.
The cashier there is very friendly and funny.
Food quality is good and the portion is decent.
T-Bones has always been good with consistency.
Steaks are great. I cannot speak about the burgers because I always get a steak there.

Now, onto the bad.
Not so much bad but here goes:

only had one bad experience with steak there. I ordered a rare steak and I couldn't eat it. I don't know if it's the type of steak but it was gross. So I only eat medium rare there..other places like keg or red lobster I'll take a rare steak. 

Price increase of the steak special from 11.99 to 16 or 17.99! Really??? One special will not fill me up so I don't go there as much as I use to because of the price increase.

T bones is a good place to chill and have a good steak and fries or mashed potato. 

3/5 due to the price increase

Here is a pic of the 32 oz combo and 16 oz combo

Thanks

PhxXbVIqHsvjRXAfT-bhmQ,"We tried the spicy horse tartare, roasted bone marrow, tendon and grits, pork belly with nori and enoki mushrooms, and tongue on brioche. 

This gastropub will fulfill any savvy foodie's taste buds. The flavoring and pairing of the oddest fresh ingredients is so unexpectedly delicious. Each dish kept tasting better, and as full as we all were, we prayed the meal would not end. Moderately priced for a gourmet experience with no frills. 

Our spicy horse tartare didn't have an overpowering acidic taste as most tartare do. In fact, the meat was fresh, light, and tender. Roasted bone marrow was richer than homemade butter and with topped with sea salt, the flavors couldn't have been more dangerously orgasmic. (Honestly I would've sucked the bone dry, but it might've been a tad inappropriate. Especially after just describing it as orgasmic.) Pork belly... well, need I say more after the words ""pork"" and belly?"" The piece of meat was cooked precisely to heaven and melted as soon as I bit into it. Finally, the tongue brioche. Growing up in New York City in a predominantly Jewish, Italian, and Irish neighborhood, I know good tongue so-to-speak. And OY VE does Black Hoof know good tongue!

The kitchen is wide open like a bar so you can see and smell your dish being cooked and plated. The selection of beers are mostly Canadian with an exception of a few imported American choices (i.e. Rogue Dead Guy). Interesting array of mixed cocktails as well for those interested in still spirits. 

Tip: don't ask to split checks as it rubs the servers the wrong way, be ready to order several dishes with tasting portions, the menu is altered often so you may not get what I've listed, and don't be discouraged by how weird the dish may sound.

So to Black Hoof: Congrats on having the best restaurant, dare I say, in Canada. Continue creating outstanding dishes, ay?",5
vAjYKDLUZUOP5oS8sx793w,"5:00 pm on Friday before the Indians game. Full house. Garage door Windows all the way around the place. Beautiful day outside. Management has the Windows all closed because ""the air conditioning is on"".

Just about as dumb as you can get.

~~~

Edit after the response of the restaurant's manager:

First, it is good to know that management is reading these reviews (and responding). I hope it makes for a better experience for diners.

It is difficult, at best, to figure out how closing the windows on a nice day solves a problem with the air conditioning. Speaking without hyperbole, it was at least as nice outside the restaurant as it was inside.

And sitting on the other side of the bar, which was open, is a magnificent idea. Too bad that we were first told that ""it wasn't open yet"" and the hostess offered to let us know when it was while we waited at the bar, which we did. Eventually, we gave up and moved to a table so we could eat after again being told it wasn't open. Minutes later, we watched dozens of people move to the cool, comfortable and enjoyable side of the restaurant while we waited for our food. No hostess or wait staff offered to help us move. We were certainly past the point of caring by then.

There were four ""hostesses"" and clearly not one had a clue.

It's not a horrible place by any stretch (my hamburger was very good) but this kind of silliness is a turnoff.",3
7BOiDvZYG_71DeA1IOYlBQ,"Out of all the Chirashi I've tried in Toronto so far, this place does it best.
 
They say you can judge a sushi chef's skill by tasting the tamago; I cannot say that I have ever enjoyed eating tamago until I had it at Japango. 
Their Chirashi was perfectly put together and the different types of fish they used provided a perfect balance of clean flavours and fantastic textures. 

I would definitely recommend the Chirashi and their signature Japango roll.

Be sure to make reservations, as this place is incredibly tiny and always busy. I think it can only seat around 20 people, maybe even fewer, at maximum.",5

B31iuIS1Mva3nC8b6S2enQ,"I went to True Food Kitchen this weekend expecting to eat healthy dishes with little taste... luckily I was disappointed! The food here is AMAZING!  

We started with a sampling of appetizers: 

There's the chicken sausage pizza- one of the better chicken pizzas I've had in a long time. They have CPK beat! The tomato fennel sauce was tangy and the chicken was very flavorful. 

Next was the edamame dumpling appetizer. The edamame paste inside was good, but the sauce they were served in was so 'delish', it made this appetizer superb! 

Mealtime: My sister and I split two dishes, the Panang curry and the Red Chili Shrimp. Actually, the kitchen split it for us (score!) since neither of us could decide between the two dishes. As a Curry lover, I was pleasantly surprised at how flavorful the curry was. It had just the right amount of Zing in it, was creamy and overall delicious. I think I have a new favorite dish! While the red chili shrimp was tasty, it was less bold (and memorable) than the curry. 

For someone who dragged her feet thinking of eating at a 'healthy food restaurant'- I can't wait to eat there again!",5

He again snapped at me and said the buzzed would go off when my order was ready. I advised him I didn't like how he was talking to me and he raises his voice and says if I don't stop yelling he would kick me out of the store.

00s-413eISxHWuFgrwk0_Q,"Okay - this place is not a Whole Foods or Giant Eagle Market Place.   If you want to get some cheap staples for the week - this is the place to go.   Don't get me wrong - I think I shop at every grocery store.

A few tips (how they save you money).
1. Have a quarter on you.  You actually rent your grocery cart.   You get your quarter back when you return it to the store.
2. Bring your own bags.   The cashiers do not bag groceries.  They do not even place it in your bags.   They will transfer groceries from one cart to another much like Costco and Sam's.
3.  You will not find everything.   You will want to go there for your staples (Milk, Eggs, some meat (Chicken), etc..   Check it out and determine what you will buy there.  You will not find organic or specialty food.

You will be surprised on how much money you will save.  My first time was awkward because I did not know what to expect.  Now - I don't have a problem and have folded it into my routine.",4
gyB6h7sqO_KoYv8yhchK3Q,"So far I've been here twice and I must say that each experience was amazing! I haven't eaten in as of yet but one day I will find the time to do so.

FYI the hottest is called ""Make em Holler"" lol. I also had cheddar grits as a side. I have to say this before I forget. Holler and Dash is only open from 7am to 2pm  so if you are looking for a late night fix this is not the place to go. If you are looking for Weekend morning breakfast or brunch then yes this is your place! Now back to the regular review. The staff is always friendly and smiling.

A0UKZckR9g3x5bEOHE9vQA,My husband and I always visit this place because I do believe it's better than mucho burrito. The food is really good. The meat is juicy and they do cook it in front of you. However sometimes they give me two pieces of chicken and I feel like I'm just eating bread. They need to weigh their chicken and make sure they are actually giving enough meat. I also want to mention for any salads or any burritos make sure you get them to drain your beans or you will end up with soggy food.,3
nEvbMqVhCoTITzxdpu5nJQ,"Their air conditioning is not working even though they will tell you it is. Super sweaty and hot inside throughout whole dining experience tonight.

Let me start off by saying they do not know how to answer a phone. Called their twice and a gentleman just picks up the phone and says hello never stating the business name. First time I thought I had the wrong number and when I tried to explain what I wanted he handed the phone off to someone else. It happened again the second time I called as well.  They definitely need to get better phone customer service for sure.

Tried the fried goyza as an appetizer. Nothing special there. The sauce they gave you with it is super spicy. So beware. Then ordered the Hokkaido style cha shu ramen which turned out to be prety salty compared to the Kyoto style ramen which they deem being as being fruity. The cha shu pork wasn't tender enough to fall apart when trying to cut it up with chopsticks and a spoon like other ramen places. Bamboo shoots we're extremely hard and tough as well. Noodles seemed strange to me compared to other ramen joints also. Did like the fact that they gave you ground pork in there as well is that with the first time I've tried that and all the ramen experiences I've had which is quite a few.

Overall for the price it was a very large portion and through the end of July they have freebies on extra noodles and extra corn so you don't have to pay for it. Ended up taking half of it home and l'll have a nice lunch for tomorrow. I just need to remember to drink lots of water to flush the salt from my system. Service was very good despite the AC not working.

I guess over all the 3 stars is because their AC was not working and I just did not like the ramen very much compared to other places such as Monta Chaya, Ramen Sora or Fukumimi. This place did not stand out for me so I probably won't be going back there.",3
-MuMRV-spttzdo5qegbv6Q,"Holy moly, you guys.  Talk about AMAZING FOOD!  Gah, I am still salivating over this meal and it's been 4 days!

We love us some Bobby Flay, so naturally we would choose to spend one of our two nights at Mesa Grill.  It was our first time, and we were very excited.  Mesa did not disappoint!

We had 7 pm reservations but headed to Caesars early to get drinks somewhere.  We ended up at Mesa early, and they were able to seat us right away. Perfect, cuz we were hungry!  We had a table in the back that was tiny and super close to our neighbors, but after the overall food experience, that didn't matter.

We started with cocktails which were tasty.  I tried the grapefruit vodka drink and my hubby had the one with Hendricks and cucumbers.  I am a vodka lover, but we both agreed his was amazing and tastier than mine.  We ordered 2 starters - the tiger prawn tamale and the smoked chicken quesadilla.  The tamale was out of this world!  I could eat that sauce on basically anything...so good!  The shrimp were delicious and the tamale was sweet with big corn kernels throughout.  If you go, you MUST get this.

A bread basket came with an amazing corn muffin (but only one...which was sad, haha), some jalapeno cheese bread and a raisin walnut bread.  Not sure why the 3rd one was there, but my hubby liked it.  

We ordered a second round of drinks, and this is where one star comes off.   The waiter touted a certain margarita, but my hubby wanted the create-your-own style with his favorite tequila.  The waiter then said, ""sir, if I may, you really need to get this one.  It's so smooth..."" and bla bla bla, so he did, but asked for it on the rocks instead of up.  It came, up.  So we asked again for it on the rocks, and it came, but was only ok.  My hubby wished the server would have just let him order what he wanted.   

For our entree, we shared the seared scallops and they were heavenly.  They were so crisp on the outside, well seasoned and perfectly done.  The grits it came with were amazing too.  Definitely recommend!

Dessert was the toasted coconut cake and I honestly don't know if I've ever had cake that good in my life!  So moist, and so coconutty!  What I wouldn't give for another slice...

The ambiance is a little casual for the price point, but still nice.  Our server was attentive but the pushiness about that marg was off-putting.  Sometimes you just have to let the customer order what they want.  All in all, this was the best food we had in Vegas and we will be back!",4

As with most of the AYCE sushi places I've tried, the chefs and staff are great here.  What makes it stand out is the flavors of their rolls and sauces to go with the rolls.  The fish is fresh and flavorful.  Umiya is priced right, in a great location, near the Palms, Rio, and Gold Coast, and when I'm in that area, craving sushi, this place is sure to be on the top of my list.  

One of the best parts about Umiya is the selection.  They have a wide variety of rolls, and so many delicious options.  If only I had known about it sooner, when I used to stay at the Rio.

H0wgmTRIEfbIp8ROmGw-1Q,"My friends and I stumbled upon here by accident.  It was the last day of our trip and we wanted a drink at Fix, but it was closed.  We had dinner reservations at Spago, so we thought we'd make our way over there and grab a drink on the way.  That's when we found Olives.  Their bar was open so we stopped in.  Their bartenders are fantastic, their martinis are huge and the water show's wonderful.  As we were sipping our drinks, I was curious about the infused vodkas.  That's when the bartender asked if I'd like a taste.  Of course I would!  So he poured me a good amount, shook it up to chill it and served it up.  That's service.

As we were sitting there, since the bartenders were so nice, we decided to cancel our Spago reservation and ate at Olives.  We also wanted to sit outside and watch the fountain show.  The patio seating is 1st come, 1st serve and we had no problem with that.  What we had a problem with was the gale force winds blowing through.  It blew down a bunch of the glasses on the tables, which changed our minds about dining al fresco.  

Once we were back inside, we ordered and our apps came out.  They were HUGE.  Just as big as their martinis.  Had I known that, I would've stuck with just the apps.  When my entree came out, I could barely eat it and ended up taking it home.  Yes, home on the plane - it was that good.

The best part was that we were sitting next to the door and the candle on our table kept blowing out.  But our server was super diligent in re-lighting it over and over again.  It was either diligence, or fear of getting his ass kicked for not keeping it lit.  Kudos to him!",4
L3iTmlJSnjSyt7ly5gTHPA,"Ever heard of escape rooms? I'm not sure where they originated (though I heard about them first in Japan), but they're a sort of real life puzzle game. Basically, a group of people is locked inside a room and given a certain amount of time to solve the puzzles inside in order to find a way out. If you've ever played 999 (on the DS) or its sequel, Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Rewards (on the 3DS and Vita), imagine something like that in real life, just without all the murder. Anyway, ever since I heard about real life escape rooms I've been wanting to try one but haven't had the opportunity until now, when my whole family decided to give it a shot.  As a note, you need to reserve a time in advance. And, unless your group buys up all the tickets for that room, you may be teamed up with some other people.

 They have three different rooms (with a fourth opening soon), and we chose the apartment. After a brief explanation, our team (myself, my parents, brother, sister-in-law, and a couple unrelated girls we were grouped with) were locked in the room and the countdown began. You have one hour to solve the puzzles and escape the room. Fail...and they let you out of the room anyway, though without the sense of accomplishment that comes from escaping yourself. I don't want to say much of anything about the puzzles to avoid spoiling things for any of you who may want to try it, but our room was comprised of a three room apartment filled with puzzles and locks. Most of our job involved finding the various keys, codes, and the like needed to unlock cabinets, safes, etc. Some of the puzzles were fairly straightforward while others required a good bit of critical and occasionally lateral thinking. There was a big monitor on one wall with our current time ticking down, as well as occasional hints provided by our guide, who was watching us on security cameras in another room. The hints were useful and targeted at whatever we were stuck on but, at the same time, they weren't too frequent and didn't give too much away either. Though they certainly did help us out at a couple of points. In the end, I think everyone contributed significantly to at least one or two of the puzzles and we managed to successfully escape with about five minutes to spare.

While not the cheapest way to spend an hour, it was a lot of fun and everyone (even my parents) had a really good time. While I don't know when I'll next have the time, I'd love to go back and take a crack at one of the other rooms.",5

XkQLa7RlMIKokpHME5YwIA,"I've visited a lot of historical memorials, monuments, and other like buildings over the years. I came across the Garfield Memorial as I was looking for the Haserot Angel at Lake View Cemetery. I was drawn to the building because of the architecture. I was glad I visited the second week of April since it opens for the season on April 1st. Lucky!!!

TIP: This is a historic building that has a lot of stairs in spiral formation. The stairs are quite narrow and there is a handrail only on one side. 

Upon entering, I was greeted by a volunteer who was extremely friendly and quite knowledgeable. I started out downstairs in the crypt area. Behind locked bars, there are two caskets (President Garfield and Mrs. Garfield) and two urns (Molly, their daughter and husband Joseph). I walked around the entire circle and was struck by the oil heaters which were intricate in their design. I know...oil heaters? Yes, they were striking. 

From there, I went upstairs to get a view of the Garfield statue from the top. The high ceilings, lighting, and overall design is breathtaking. I continued my journey to the balcony where you can get a shot of downtown Cleveland. 

On your way out, be sure to visit the small gift area, make a donation, and buy a map of the cemetery (the booklet with descriptions). For $5, it will save you some time wandering around.",5

Today the guy told me he gave me $6.00 off, WRONG...I was charges full price for the product and tax NO DISCOUNT.  

Time to take my business to another store.  These guys had two chances and the employees are extremely dishonest and disrespectful.  Sad sad sad as I used to like this place but now they have people working ere who have no respect for military or customers, only making the most money for the store.",1

T-7POa5AINgCGs2r-8-vWg,"Came here with some colleagues post night shift at 8 am on a Monday. Considering that many of us had worked three night shifts, our server acted as if she had just finished five shifts. She was very abrupt and was constantly making snide comments. When asked what teas they had, she would roll her eyes. She continued to give us many eye rolls and was huffing as if she was very busy (mind you, we were the only patrons). Her sarcasm, attitude, and forgetfullness definitely made our breakfast experience very negative.

The menu has many breakfast options which suited our groups taste. Some meals came with free coffee/tea from Monday to Friday.
 
The price was $10 + for 2 eggs, meat, and home fries, the food was ok, nothing special. I would have rated it higher, however the service was absolutely awful. If you've had a rough day and choose to come here, I hope you won't have the same server that we did.",2
k35j_wQuDr4vrXbMEdFXKw,We love it here. They always do a great job with both our dogs and one of them is pretty skiddish. They are easy to schedule with and I think they pricing is very reasonable. Thank you Prestige for always taking great care of our dogs!,5
ATOWBHH-l0cb8vqope8gpQ,"It's cheap, but it wasn't great. Lucky noodles is essentially the same concept as Deer Garden. Its a choose your on adventure bowl of noodles. You have a choice of soup, noodles, 2 toppings and a drink. 

I had the peanut chili soup, flat rice noodles, beef brisket and bean curd. The peanut chili soup was watered down and definitely not as rich as Deer Garden. The brisket felt a bit old and the bean curd was just bean curd. The deer garden version is extra fried for more texture. Overall, it was a fairly sub-par bowl of noodles. Even their milk tea was a bit watered down and not as smooth. 

Food aside, the place has ample seating and service is decent, but very dark inside. Would not recommend.",2

uddlFEdPQT5jyI2Yz1c-Eg,"I literally just finished eating my food I had delivered, and I felt compelled to write a review.  I normally spend a good amount of time giving GOOD reviews, because I feel that the majority of people complain constantly.  However, if my gripes will help somebody save money by not ordering from here, then my work is done here.

For starters, when I called for delivery, somebody answered and said ""Hello"" as it was their personal phone.  No business name, nothing.  This to me is highly unprofessional and I probably should have taken that warning and hung up the phone... but I didn't.
I tried to get pork fried rice with my meal, and all he said was ""no.""  I had to ask multiple questions to find out if they had it, could subsitute it, heck, I even asked for them to charge me for it... and he kept saying ""no.""
Delivery time was accurate... so that I can't complain about.  But I will say, I'm pretty sure they ran over my food before dropping it off.  My sauce that I ordered on the side was tipped over and on the verge of spilling.  I ordered food for my boyfriend as well, and his was overflowing with grease, and the grease lined the inside of the bag and made its way into my box of food as well - which I purposely had steamed to try to be a little more healthy.  My box was cracked, and pieces of chicken were starting to fall out into the plastic bag.
I happened to order sesame chicken - my dish had NO veggies with it - and I've never NOT had veggies (or at least broccoli) with it before.  Crab puffs were horrible, basically fried wonton wrappers with no cream or crab on the inside.

I'm NOT impressed with this place and will never order again.",1

1Qlt33rc0jZL2rDGNlMOaQ,"I just tried the Sicilian pie yesterday, and I am doing a back flip. It is as close to home (Brooklyn) that you will ever find here in Phoenix.

WEYKwUDxq4g9xB84JTzZng,"My friend told me that people from Brazil are known as ""Brazzers"", I'm not sure if this is accurate or not, perhaps one of you can tell me. Whatever they are called, they make freaking amazing Pasteis De Nata.

What to get: Pasteis De Nata, a Sumol Orange drink, maybe more.
What else: A Pasteis De Nata is a Portuguese Custard Tart, and it will cost you next to Nata.

I've been in love with Brazilian/Portuguese Custard Tarts for years now, ever since I first discovered them in... damn, I can't even remember where. Possibly in Toronto itself at Golden Wheat Bakery.

This place makes an excellent version, not perhaps as perfect as my faves at Progress, Brick Street and Golden Wheat, but it's right up there and easily a five-star bakery.

It's flaky, with a very thin but doughy crust.

If you're lucky for the Dutch bakery you're on the wrong side of the street. You should head over to Pastry Dutchy on the left hand side.

This place is huge (like... never mind) with tons of other options, and masses of drink choices imported from Portuguese-speaking countries such as the excellent Sumol Orange Soda (makes any orange soda made in America taste like crap, which they do anyway - try it), and Guarana sodas of course.

Service is nice, the place is busy and spacious and friendly, prices are okay (not cheap by any means), and it really feels like a little corner of Brazil in the middle of Toronto, which granted is a very Brazilian-influenced city. 

And if your underwear is feeling poorly, count yourself lucky because I have it worse. My bra's ill.",5
U2SD6zWedOhiJFivoDyKdg,"I have been coming to Carly's for several years, usually as a jumping off point for a downtown adventure. This has always been a great neighborhood bar, the recent patio expansion has really put it over the top.

Sometimes they have The Walking Dead on the little tv on Sundays which is great if you like gore while you're eating, which I do. My wife does not though because she is weird, but we won't go into that right now, I'll tell you all about her over the coming months and years.

My favorite sandwich is the Santa Fe, there's just something about those green chillis and pepperjack cheese that make me want to stab a zombie in the skull.

The staff is always nice, def not hipster service, good music. The patio is also nice for people-watching the 1 day a month when people are gallivanting around Roosevelt for First Friday. I say people but what I really mean is the throng of teenagers roaming around.

7 thumbs up.",5

Needless to say I will be stopping in more often to try other items.",5
ufedRiJba-ipWvVRM-K8YA,"My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant for Valentine's day. We had reservations, and were made to sit in a not-so-private table (thats why the four stars). The bread (some kind of white bread with sesame seed crust) was warm, fresh and tasty. The spinach soup with egg white and chicken broth was comfort food, and tasty. We had the Chianti on their menu, which went very well with the Veal Marsala. The marsala was very very well done--kudos to them, and the portion size was just right. I forget what the name of the dish (veal dish) that my boyfriend had but that was also amazing. We finished our dinner with a chocolate torte with pear and connoli--yumm!! The two of us are very impressed with the food and we will almost certainly go back soon.",4

I'm very glad I didn't read the Yelp reviews, because it seems most of the reviews are written by bitter customers who can't follow the simple AYCE rules of this restaurant. (Making sure you eat all the portion, without wasting the rice etc.)

The place is owned by a nice Korean family. I was pleased with how friendly they were, and the fish was very fresh. The price was right, and while I didn't get the AYCE, I spoke with them and found out that unlike other places, Sushi Boy doesn't place a time limit on your eating session. 

I would gladly return here if I'm in the area.",4

kJ54rVVielFkvuoLM0Xmeg,"A couple of days into spring and weather is very cold in Cleveland. Why? I needed a leap to faith for lunch to shake my panic principle and thaw out. I had a good lunch. 

Restaurant is deceptively large. There is rectangle bar formation as you enter that confused me for a second. I recovered and my guest and I were presented a booth in adjunct dining area. Small criticism restaurant was cold, maybe I was sipping too many cokes, but coming from the cold I expected to warm up a bit. not bitter. Our waitress wore a velcro wrist band support. I found her very attractive for an older woman. I am against arthritis yet I could not help but imagine us in the sack together. Something similar to Bukowski novel. My gaze did not betray my intention to be a respectable patron.

Onto the meal, I had tasty kraut balls for appetizer. Tangy sauce was good complement. I had king lean corned beef. very good and I smashed the pickle. snicker cake to go. I just finished the cake, mmm that was some good fill.",3

sSEZTjAzknnNSVe643ysBA,"One of the top five meals I have EVER had in my life.  My friend has eaten here before and he wanted me to experience this amazing restaurant.  We had a nice table off to the side with a partial view of the fountains.  Since it was my first time at the restaurant my friend let me have the chair with the view.  We decided to share our plates.
1.  Steak Tartare:  This was the main reason why I came.  It was magical.  The punch of flavors was amazing.  You pick up different flavors all over your palette.  
2.  Crab Cake:  The subtle flavor of the crab was allowed to shine.  The spice was just right to add to and not take away from the crab.  
3.  Beat and Goat Cheese Salad:  This was the only item all night that I liked, but wasn't blown away by.  The quinoa and pumpkins seeds were not my favorite.
4.  Peppercorn Rib Eye:  We both loved the Rib Eye, but we agreed that the next time we come we would opt to get something else.  We felt the peppercorn wasn't needed on such amazing cuts of steak.  
5.  Veal Chop:  Best veal I have ver had.  The meat was perfectly cooked and juicy.  The meat was outstanding on its own.  It didn't really need the rich sauce that accompanied the meat.  
6.  Cream Spinach:  Excellent
7.  Truffle Potato Gnocchi:  Flavor overload!  Incredibly reach and decadent.  
We skipped dessert and opted to have a cappuccino instead.  We ended speaking with a lovely group of ladies at the next table visiting from England and we joined them for coffee.  
One thing that I LOVED about this experience - we were not rushed.  We arrived at 9 PM and left the restaurant at 1:20 AM.  We were able to savor every bite and enjoy our company over an amazing meal.  After the restaurant emptied out a bit my friend moved his chair to the other side of the table to see the fountains too.  Wonderful experience.",5

The salsas absolutely stole the show. The chips and guac for $4.50 is a relative steal in Toronto, and was tangy and flavourful. 

I tried three different options at the salsa bar and came away impressed with all of them. 

The Baja fish tacos were soft and flavourful, as was the chicken tinga. 

Decor and vibe are on point. 

Will be back.",5

K9oBdxO5n500OgwTaDOQww,"I went here on a whim, and very hungry! I was surprised to find a favorite in their meatball sub. It is delicious on so many levels. The bread really makes it I think. I'm not sure if they bake it in house or buy fresh and local, but it's always toasted perfectly but soft on the inside. Plus, they pile on the mozzarella cheese and have a good ratio of sauce (I love my marinara sauce!). 

Just keep in mind if you're popping in you may have to wait for about 15 minutes, but that ensures you're getting a fresh made dish. If you're really in a hurry make sure you call ahead. I really need to take a break from the meatballs sub, if possible, and try their pizza next!",4
crLnsr9aPHmJmrtpsT_sxA,"I normally have nothing good to say about Pep Boys, but the employees at this location were a saving grace during an otherwise all around distressing weekend last year.

The boy and I drove to Vegas for the weekend in his Mini Cooper for his college reunion and for my sister's annual Oscar party.  We drove over to Paris to meet up with two of his college friends, and when we got back to the car to drive them back to their hotel, the battery in the Cooper was dead.  

When the tow truck finally arrived, the guy had an awful time getting the car jumped.  It took him about 30 minutes and the battery was barely keeping a charge.  Every minute or so the lights would dim and the car sounded like it was going to die.  We had no idea where the closest Mini dealer was, and since it was early evening we figured their service department would be closed anyway.  I remembered seeing a Pep Boys on Charleston close to my sister's house so we headed over, silently praying that the Coop would not die on the freeway on the way there.

Sadly when we got to Pep Boys, they did not have any Mini Cooper compatible batteries.  They told us to check the Auto Zone down the street.  Luckily we had not turned off the car.

Praise the sweet baby Jesus, Auto Zone had a battery.  But they would not install it for us.  Luckily we kept the car running again.  The boy bought the battery anyway and fearing the worst, we headed back to Pep Boys.

The guys at Pep Boys were nice enough to install the new Auto Zone battery for us sad folks from California even though it was by now close to closing time for them.  And best of all, they didn't charge us anything for the installation.  They got some serious good karma that day, and I thank them for all of their help!",4

crsv1tM5GbMFSIO8zUo-7w,"Classic Dive Bar, but with great food.   This place is interesting from when you go in.  They have some table games such as table bowling and air hockey.    They also have a small concert area where they have comedians, band, etc.    I was there at an off time, so it was relatively slow, but was getting busy while people were waiting for a band to start.   The food was good.   There was few choices, the main dishes are hot dogs, sliders, and burgers.  There is probably 25 toppings to pick from for your hot dog, which makes things fun.   The prices are decent.   The service was also good (from a brand new waitress).    This place is interesting how they integrate staff into their design.   Their facebook posts introduce them and they have specialty cocktails that each bartender make up.  This place also has good specials.    On Saturday afternoon, they have $1 sliders, which I will have to check out sometime.",4
m6pvWUau9oh5o6vo8ZgPlA,"Two things I love about Sprouts: The deli sandwiches and their tropical island fruit mix.

The deli here is just awesome.  Sandwiches are big, cheap, and packed with delicious.  When I worked in the area, I would grab lunch here at least twice a week.  Which brings me to my next, star-dropping point...

Every so often, they'd inexplicably screw up my sandwich order.  I don't know how it happens.  For the uneducated, Sprouts has a seemingly efficient ordering system.  Every ingredient is listed on a piece of paper and you indicate what you would like.  If something doesn't have a check mark next to it, it doesn't get put onto the sandwich.  So why do you put mustard on my turkey masterpiece just often enough to notice?  I don't know how I could possibly make your job any easier than it already should be.

Aside from sandwiches, their tropical island fruit mix is the best of any grocery chain.  If you're into dried fruit, it comes highly recommended.",4
jA3K9AFN-bdUtf7Z5ofLnA,"I made a pit stop at this restaurant for a quick bite with my friends before watching a movie. Our waiter gave us our menus and then disappeared for 20mins. We had to get another server to order our apps. There were about 3 different people helping us get 1 app and 1 desert put through. The inconsistency and wait time was ridiculous. We had to eat our food really fast so we wouldn't miss our movie. 

The food was alright. The spinach dip with warm pretzels was nice but the nachos were kinda stale. The desert was pretty good - the fried donut balls tasted fresh and came with 3 different sauces (caramel, chocolate and lemon). The only sauce that tasted good with the donuts was the caramel sauce. The chocolate sauce tasted water down and the lemon one just tasted gross. 

My overall rating has a lot to do with the customer service. I shouldn't have to chase down my waiter to order food, ask for the bill or ask for a simple water refill. That's huge pet peeve of mine - it shouldn't be hard to fill up an empty water glass.",2

1puHB9B2L3JEdwBADSzHpg,"I am very, very disappointed in JJ's. 

We had a party of 20 here today, to celebrate two birthdays.

My boyfriend and I brought in two cakes. We were told it's a dollar per head. We asked since when was the policy has been in affect, since this is not the first time we had brought cakes to celebrate birthdays. We were told by an older gentleman that it has been in place for a couple years now. NOW I know that is A LIE, since all the other birthdays have been recent. And then older gentleman tried to cover his lie BY changing his policy has been affect for a year and half, another lie. Basically the man is making up just any excuse to grab some extra money. Because he has never mentioned it to us many events before.

And now let's get to the service, we waited at the foyer for a good half hour before greeted. Another 15-20 minutes to be seated, even though we have had this reservation a week in advance.

The food was lacking, they kept forgetting half the stuff we ordered. The food was flavourless.

AND THE FINAL LET DOWN...

We gave specific instructions for the cakes, which candles goes on which, we even sharpie the boxes with the numbers. Please tell me how the cakes were brought out without the candles on and not lit up. And then they asked the Birthday boys which candles goes on which. HOW DO YOU MESS THIS UP?!

Over all very disappointing.",1

gNSrt_TH-2bo8n4x5a80lA,"Used to love this theater, but it's been more of a hassle coming here lately, not sure how much longer we'll keep it up.  The last few times we came, there was always an issue...while it's nice they are putting in new seating, the seats are not good for shorter legs. I guess the idea is you put the footrest up, but not everyone wants to do that.  Once it's up, it's extremely hard to adjust, whether going too far or not enough or not doing anything at all...seats shouldn't have to come with instructions.  

The new bar area is nice but it eliminated a bathroom.  You'd think with being down to only one bathroom in the lobby, it would be cleaner, but it wasn't.  

The snack bar area is always a mess in the self serve areas.

I preferred getting tickets at the booths outside.  Even if someone is working the entrance inside, they make you use the machines now & I don't normally bring reading glasses to the movies....also don't like touching the same screens everyone else has on line, always feel I have to wash my hands afterwards. 

Lastly with 30 theaters, why they have only a few showings & limit so many shows to reserved seating is the biggest inconvenience & has us going to harkins instead.  We're just not feeling this place anymore. It was so much better before they went & changed everything.",3

They wouldn't respond to a letter that explained the situation and items in concern. Even after stating in the invoice if there were any questions or concerns please give them a call.

Dus40Guhur9T-WpkQOTJTw,"Clean, brightly-lit environment and a large selection of one- to three-loaders await you, but what makes me return are the friendly attendants, who try their best to offer assistance!  I love how w/out your even asking, they'll run outside and retrieve the roll-away carts from you, but not before helping you load your full baskets into your car!  These attendants deserve raises for working as hard like they do.

You""ll find change and vending machines (junk food and cleaning materials) if you need anything, and there are TVs and free wi-fi to keep you company while you wait!  (One gripe: please add some electric sockets!)",3
I_5A788QWMjq0hfbfE2d-w,"Brown Road, just east of Higley. Next door to KFC, just to the east of KFC on the south side of Brown Road. Easy access off Brown or exit Higley by the Iowa Cafe.

Check out the menu online first.

No indoor seating or dining. Drive through or walk-up to a different window. Average time order to delivery is about five minutes or less. 

Great food, decent prices. Cute bright orange plastic forks which are mostly useless because they bend to easily. I think they recently raised their prices across the board. Like most carry out restaurants their napkins are not worth taking, they do not tolerate actually being used like most of them are these days.",4
MpV8Rfj11kgMvb1DbfIb_w,"Love the variety of food to choose from Marche.  Everything from healthy to the not so; and everything from pizza to stir-fried.  
I ended up with a roast beef wrap that came with a bowl of vegetable soup.  The wrap was meaty and delicious.  And it was made right in front of me quickly.  
Just make sure you don't lose the card given to you.  That's what you use to pay.
The environment itself is nice.  There is an area that feels like a patio, and then there are areas inside where you can sit down.  It's nicely decorated like a restaurant.  An upscale foodcourt!",5
kqkL-zDK8KRUk7ryX0-aJQ,"This place is adorable! Its like Dennys meets Kawaii. Its greasy spoon food - very yummy. They have a separate restaurant and lounge. If you come on a Sunday or holiday, make sure to come early because they get a line out the door. Its worth it though with the decor and food. The lounge is cute with fire pits and comfy couches. Not really ADA accessible in the lounge, but the restaurant is fine. If you like ice cream, order the sunday - but be warned it about 5 lbs of ice cream!",5
L8mmFDq5QHti-VtXFHw_Ow,"this place is great for no frills, basic ""do it your self"" cheep furniture. You pick what you like and usually end up getting what you paid for . However be aware, their management has absolutely no concept of a thing called customer service. 
Recently, I bought a dinning set from them, which was missing some parts, when I contacted the store, the manager bluntly said that he will contact his suppliers in Malaysia, and will get the missing part in about a weeks time. Well I waited for a week, and after not hearing back from this guy, called him again. Once again the person did not offer any apology or regret, and asked me to wait another 5-10 days. Well after giving it another week I called the person again, and was told that if I cannot wait for the part to arrive from Asia, I can go to Scarborough and pick it myself from a warehouse, he simply refused to get it delivered to me or even have it available at his store for me to pick up. As I had no other option left, I had to drive all the way from Milton to Scarborough to pick the missing parts, which could simply have been deliver to me in a legal size envelope. Well I have learned my lesson well and will never be buying from this place again. So if you still decide to go ahead and try them, just hope you don't have to do a return or replacement.",1
uf-DJL4H79W2ggsoei_NDg,"I made a reservation on a Mon for a Wed night. Good thing I did! I was quite surprised that the place was filled up by 7:30p. Walking into S&F, the environment and feel is very modern and upscale. You would think that this would be a place serving something other than Japanese (let alone sushi). 

I ordered salmon & white tuna sashimi, spicy salmon roll, rainbow rolls, fresh mango salad, edamame beans, bangkok style pad thai and pineapple fried rice, butter fish tataki (this was for 2 people). Quality and taste-wise, the sashimi certainly was NOT anywhere close to what smaller restaurants serve up in Markham. The mango salad was certainly tasty and just the right portion. My favourites would be the pad thai and fried rice. They were both sweet (in taste) and the pad thai had a good amount of heat. I ended the night off with a deep fried ice cream which me and my friend enjoyed. I believe the batter is made up of corn flakes!

The speed at which my 2nd orders came out were unfortunately slow. The place was certainly packed which could've explained why. It took about 15 minutes for my green tea to arrive at the table.",3
vGg3xIRRU200EIznf6joBA,"Key Features: Best cooked Swiss Chalet burger in the GTA

Yeah yeah - so there was that one time on Mother's Day when the waitress messed up our orders, gave us cold food, and was an all around, less than delightful server - but I tell you what - years of being fantastic will help me look past that.

There's one reason to come to this Swiss Chalet - and I'll tell you what it is, their burgers.  I don't know why the other Swiss Chalet's in the GTA can't cook them properly (and believe you me, I've searched around) but this place - they put a patty on a bun that is so juicy, you'd think it was cooked straight off of a George Foreman grill (if you believed the hype about how well a George Foreman grill can cook burgers.  Which I don't.)

The point is - don't think of this Swiss Chalet as a chicken join.  Think of it as a burger joint.  Now, I don't want you to go there, have the one time they're not cooked to perfection - because as I said above, I - too - had a bad experience once.  By 90% of the time, there's nothing more that I would want from my meal.

It's an all around treat.  And a great place to kick back with grandma, and talk about life, and all that comes between it.",4
xKCRuvQSoHlZCMCu0vjWMQ,Bad meat and bad customer service!! I ordered the roast beef Panini and the roast beef was green and shiny.  I called to complain and their response was we just cut it so it cannot be bad.  My company used to order from them all the time -- no more.,1

8XYXvnB5NXa5msiKb6dDkQ,"Yum!!!  Finally, a place that serves fried chicken.  And not just any fried chicken; the BEST fried chicken I've had in Phoenix!  The catfish was also delicious.  We tried the macaroni, green beans, cole slaw, and fries (for the toddler).  The sides alone could be a meal.  We didn't have anything to take home, so we ordered ribs to go.  The owners are friendly and greet you as you walk in and then they come around to check on you and chat for a few minutes.  We will be back, to try the rest of the menu.  Keep in mind this is not fast food.  It will take 20 minutes or so to prepare your meal for you.  Good food is always worth the wait, in my opinion.",5
SIEpzEMezFA9dyNFTUaiDA,"Best item I had that I would go back again for:  shoe-string fries

Items ordered:

- Potato Twisters:  It was fun to see a huge pile of carby-goodness.  A bit of a smokey taste.  If you like a softer version of kettle chips, this one is for you. 

- Southwest Chicken Salad:  Nothing spectacular.  The lettuce which composed most of the salad was a bit bitter.  It would've been better if more of the ""other"" items listed on the menu were present.

- Mini burger sampler:  
The turkey burger was tastiest of all 3 (IMO).
Beef burger was standard for a sit down restaurant.  
Ahi burger didn't have enough ahi.  It was two thin slices.  So, you were biting mostly into bread.  

- Captain Hook Burger (Fried Cod):  The crust was very salty, but the crispiness of the fish was excellent. I didn't care for the sweet relish.

- Iced Tea:  perfect.... freshly brewed 


Service:  very slow (They need to hire a runner to deliver the food to the tables... especially since they sold over 1000 GroupOn deals.)

Price:  Pricier than Smash Burger for about the same quality just nicer ambiance

Ambiance:  A fun place to go on a casual date.  Cute decor (contemporary cowboy?)  The booths are great for really tall people.  For short people like me, it felt like I saw sinking in the seat and had to sit up to reach the table.   

I would only go back for the turkey burger & the shoe string fries, but I'd have to get some kind of deal because their prices are just more than many of the other restaurants around town.",2

I ordered the cheviche and it shows up made out of oj and has mandarin oranges in it blecccck way to sweet cant even taste the shrimp laaame.  My friend got the veggie enchiladas and the veggies tasted like oil not even butter which would have been better they did use cotija cheese though.  We high tailed it out of there after that thank goodness,2
K5nz-oIoUU2TCfVbDRUMSA,"For anyone who has tried calling, they are indeed still open. They just never answer their phone, or even have a voicemail set up.

Maybe they should answer their phones, so they can perhaps allow call-ahead seating? Because the place is packed on the weekends and often has a wait out the door. For the most part, the food is good and the portions are large. The staff is nice, too. Not the best place in Pittsburgh for breakfast, but a solid option.",4

But it was the dessert that really stood out: we chose Baked Alaska, which was INCREDIBLE!!! The waiter explained this dessert isn't always offered, so call ahead.

EJXaOxSDiKNvp99UBUg8mg,"The cashier, ""Brad H."" was extremely rude. There wasn't a line at this register, and now I see why. When we asked about trying our phone number, without saying anything, he points at the card swiping machine, then as I was inputting my phone number, he swipes his own card. What was the purpose in telling me to do it myself, if he was just going to collect my points? It was just dumb. No big deal though, I just don't understand the reasoning behind it. 

Then another customer puts her groceries on the conveyor belt, but since there wasn't a transaction separator bar thing, she kept holding her groceries, which in turn kept the automatic conveyor belt going. He looks at her and says, ""stop! Just stop touching it! The belt will stop by itself!"" I was immediately disgusted by his attitude. Even if she didn't know that it was automatic, he didn't have to come at her like that! He could of simply said, ""don't worry about the belt, it'll stop on its own,"" or something according to that. His attitude was completely unnecessary. 

After he bagged all of our groceries, it was very evident he just gave no f**ks today. He put my bananas with all the canned goods, my meats with my vegetables, and my juices and bottled products with my eggs; all making them heavy, and I had to double bag them myself at the end.

The store itself was just like any other Von's. Outdated, and dusty.. But at the same time, organized. If I were to come back to this location, I will not be going to Brad's register. I don't care if all the other lines are super long and I have to wait 30 minutes to check out. He definitely ruined my day!",1

It doesn't taste like cheap low grade pretzels out of a freezer. They are perfectly crisp yet fluffy inside. The wings are great and they give you a perfect amount for one person. I got the corleon and the mozzarella was fresh as were the veggies. It had the perfect amount of spices. The balsamic drizzle was right amount of sweet. I never save room for dessert but I need to sometime to try their shakes. Friends of mine swear by their burgers and I will certainly be back to try one soon!",5
QBmz_FNaoR4liDhHPySScg,"Jamba Juice is Jamba Juice. I can't really rate this place higher or worse than my other review, because it's just the same experience at any Jamba Juice you go to. Same setting, same menu, same service, same same same. Only difference here is that it's in Las Vegas and it might be a lot easier to enjoy it in this heat more, but other than that it's just the same as it is back at home (San Jose). So I'm just going to copy and paste my other Jamba Juice review on to here..........

Always love this place especially on a nice warm/hot day. Depending on the weather is what I usually get smoothie/shot. If it's just a normal day and I need that extra boost of energy, I usually stop by here before heading to school and grabbing me a double shot macha energy with OJ. If my stomach feels a little empty I usually grab me a pretzel because its easy to eat on the go. Their sandwiches are good too, I just don't like to get e'm often because I'm usually in a hurry. I have yet to try any other competing smoothie places because this already completes my satisfaction, but it's still lacking a star, because I feel that it can do better and there just might be another smoothie spot that taste better that I have yet to try. On a hot day or when I'm just in the mood for a smoothie, I get a a ""White Gummy"" which is on their secret menu, and employees make it taste like the white gummy bear candy. I like to get others too, but this is my all time favorite.

There is a few others on the secret menu, that MOST if not all Jamba Juice's make. You can easily search up Jamba Juice secret menu and you'll find a bunch of e'm, but here is a few of my favorites.

Pink Star: Made to taste like everyone's all time starburst flavor (Pink starburst)

Blue/Green/Pink/Red Gummy: Made to taste like the color coated gummy bears

Chocolate Gummy Bear: Made to taste like the chocolate covered gummy bears you get at the stores

Reese's Pieces: Made to taste like the candy bar.

Skittles: Made to taste like the skittles candies.

NOTE: Remember there is way more on the secret menu, but those are just some of my favorites. There is a list below of some of the others that I haven't tried yet, and remember there are more, just do a quick search. Also keep in mind that not all shops make them, so ask them if they can make it before you order it.

I'm not quite sure how healthy these are suppose to be (I heard that they're not on the menu because they don't recommend them because it's only a snack smoothie, not something as healthy as their normal menu), so if some of you guys are that are trying to watch your diet, you might consider checking the nutrition on these, but if you're just trying to try something different, then go wild!

i866IwSDA0WGSuzGBv2OAA,"A nice change of pace from Tim Horton's and Starbucks. Conveniently located near the Chester Subway Station in the Carrot Commons Mall.

Waiting for a UYE to start and since it involved sweets, I knew I needed a good breakfast to start off with. 

Had their Sausage, Egg and Cheese breakfast sandwich (made in house) and their new Passionfruit mango fusion iced tea. A tasty and filling breakfast. My only complaint was that after finishing half of my iced tea the second half tasted watered down. 

It takes a minute for the staff to warm up to you especially when you're asking lots of questions and taking tons of pictures like I always do. Slight language barrier with one of the cashiers; but if you're a regular, you're treated like gold. Comfy chairs but positioned too close for comfort. I would come back if I was in the area to try their sweets from Rococo bakery and more of their drink menu.",3

It's my husband who loves Mexican food, I mean I like it..but it's not the type of food that I would crave for. This place is okay, but not all the time. There are times that they can be not satisfactory.. There are some incident that they do not put all your orders in the bag. I don't know if they forgot, or it's just pure negligence! 2 nights ago, we went to their drive thru, confident that we got everything, which we had, but soon as we're home, I noticed when I grabbed my chicken chicken burrito, it's too thin like there's nothing in there. So I opened it up, and I guess what? I'm right! There's barely nothing! There was just a tiny little bit of rice, 3 pieces of some tiny chicken, and that's it! 
I am so disappointed!!! Both 2 burritos are the same, the other one is even worse! So we went back, my hubby still approached them kindly expressing our concern and inconvenience, I mean like hello if this thing happened to other people, they would get a very crunchy swearing and all the evil names already! We still chose to be kind. 
They made new burritos for us, I thought they're going to make it up for us, but I'm wrong. They just put a little more rice and some chicken. And gave us some cinnamon crackers as a consolation! Big deal! 
Well it is what it is, and they are what they are! I still like Del Taco better! They have REAL BURRITO there! We only come here because it's the closest to the house.",2

One of its main attractions are the FREE old school arcade games (ex. Pac-Man, Super Mario World, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, etc). It's a great place to go with a group of friends and play some old school arcade games. In addition to the arcade games, they also have an open bar. Their beer menu is pretty unique, a lot of lagers I've never heard of. I'm currently enjoying dark beers nowadays so I decided to order the WELLINGTON COUNTY DARK ALE (5%). I enjoyed this lager very much! Not too bitter and you don't really get bloated.

Although I like the beer and games, I find the price of the beers to be a bit pricey. I understand they are import brands but $7 for 16 ounces is a bit much. Anyways, that was my only complaint about the bar but I'll definitely come back. It's a great place to chill with your friends, drink beer, and play some retro arcade games.",3

So I finally decided to venture down and get myself some Tacos! I mean it is a Taco truck right? I went around 1pm and there was no one at the truck. I walked up and was promptly greeted by a man to take my order. I begin the ""uhhhh"" & was staring at the menu & I guess this told him that I was new because he asked ""1st time?"". I said yes and he promptly recommended the Hibachi. In my mind I'm thinking, ""but isn't this a Taco truck? Why wouldn't he recommend a Taco 1st?"". This immediately deterred my initial craving for a taco, because they must not be the great if the taco truck Isn't recommending them, and got the Hibachi Chicken with no mushrooms. The wait was about 5-8 minutes. As I sat down I thought omg this looks so good. Hibachi with cabbage and onions instead of the typical zucchini was refreshing. The food was pretty good. It tasted fresh. Nothing I got excited about thougg, but no complaints either. It was just ok. The white sauce was unusually runny to me though. Im a dipper but dipping in that sauce just made a mess. Then when puring it over the food It ran straight to the bottom of the paper bowl that they put the food in & barely stuck to the food.I doubt I'll be back unless I am really pressed for time.

Fried rice was simple but also tasty. Service was attentive and friendly. Down sides, a little small, so make a reservation and pricey. I also like bigger scallops.",4
I6Brga8habUbdposW1TxxQ,Assistant manager Sean has the worst customer service. When I called to ask questions he got so defensive and hung up on me. Horrible customer service.,1
Dvn1R5YH1HB5KQoE4mok5g,"I have been here many times, mainly for dinner.  I have found the food to always be fresh and tasty. The portions are generous and, if you wish, you can have beer or wine with your meal. The beer is always cold and the wine very smooth and aromatic. Bread rolls are complimentary as are lemon wedges if you wish to top your greens or chicken. 
Desserts are fantastic. Whether gelato or pastry, they are fresh and decadent. Coffee is made with fresh ground beans. Espresso long is my favourite. 
The restaurant is very clean. Management takes great pride in providing a welcoming, friendly and cozy environment ideal for families. There are floor to ceiling windows everyone providing a light, airy atmosphere. 
There is ample parking and the location is quite convenient.",5

Must orders- spiced deep fired battered shrimp, lotus steam rice, garlic beef, salty fish fried vermicelli. All were perfectly done and full of flavour. 

Service is just ok tho. Some of the wait staff are far better than others (who constantly forget what you ordered or look right past you)

Honey lemon drink only had 3 thin slices of lemon... Couldn't taste​ it at all. 

Great food and reasonable prices. Keepong this one on the rolodex.",4
6vX7dq8pYR-lhgMA9VXFRA,Ambrosia's renovation continues and now they have their new cashier system open its much better than the chaos they used to have. The aisles are also more spacious and they have some new refrigeration units for the frozen & chilled items. They started carrying Chao vegan cheese which I've been dying to try but couldn't find anywhere. They have also expanded their produce and breads section. Can't wait to see what the place will look like when all the renos are over. Hopefully they will have more events too!,4
2fvLSSgcioauXPnbaTa_uQ,I agree with the previous reviewer. I'm used to No Frills stores that stock ethnic food. Dave's No Frills is very small and lacks a lot of the products I have come to expect from a No Frills. For instance I was looking for chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and they didn't have it. They were all out of regular jalepeno peppers too. It was very disappointing.,2

KQUNNkwWdnXRbSe-hd9AsQ,Severely understaffed with stylists who vocalize their displeasure with the hours they're working. A 30-minute wait time because mom and her 4 kids (under 6) slip in the door just ahead of me. The waiting area becomes reminiscent of a Chuck E. Cheese's with toys constantly banging and kids complaining. I had enough of the environment after about 15 minutes and left. The $2 off coupon was enough to get me in the door long enough to discover this isn't a place I'd ever return to.,1

I cannot speak highly enough about this location, as well as Miss Jester and Mr. Chambers. They are absolutely fantastic. It has been exactly what we needed without even knowing it. He has gained so much confidence and had so much fun. Mr. Chambers has this gift of supporting and encouraging the kids in class while also garnering their respect and obedience. It is obvious he actually enjoys what he is doing and has fun. And he has always been willing to be as involved as he can be in their personal lives as well. The focus is truly on teaching them life skills for the long term. Miss Jester is always helpful and positive. She regularly checks in with all the families and keeps everyone informed of events. They have also created an environment where the kids of all ages support and encourage one another. I would recommend this place to anyone. Awesome, best ever, love Shadow Hills!",5
8_ONkR8oe1Ycim96c-fXIw,"What I like the most about this place is the PORK BUNS, not the ramen. The pork buns are delicious!!! I've been to Momofuku about 4 times now but every time I get the ramen I always wish for something better. I mean, it's good but it's not the best in town (aka Kinton).  Maybe all the hype got my expectations way too high, I don't know, but what I do know is that despite the fact that I didn't fall in love with the ramen, I'll probably go back... and I'll probably order ramen. & pork buns!
I will also go back because they have Milkbar right upstairs for those of us that are always craving for something sweet. Sometimes I only go for the Milkbar goodies. 

The staff is very chill and young, just like the space itself. They have long tables so you will be sitting next to strangers and if you dare, maybe start a conversation. 
The atmosphere is lively and loud but in a good way and you'll have a good time. 
I took my dad once (he prefers Chinese comfort food) and he loved it, maybe because he was starving... Nonetheless, if he enjoyed it a lot, you will too!",4

This is a classy, quiet place where you kick it old school without having to shout over bachelorette parties or re-mixed Kraftwerk.

rVg25JdZBzoGqRNmab4lXQ,"First time: 
If you are over drawing/ filling in your brows every morning, tia is the girl to help you! She takes the time to make sure your brows are absolutely perfect and your are 100% satisfied before she starts. Her work area is completely clean and sanitary and she makes sure you are comfortable during the procedure.. the pain is really minimal! Tia really took the time to listen to what you want the end result to look like and made sure that both brows were even. I felt so comfortable and would recommend Tia to anyone who is thinking about microblading! 

6 months later: 
Tia is amazing!!! she originally did my brows in the first place. But I went back in for my touch up.. it was quick and added a little bit more volume and she filled in some areas that has faded..  Microblading is amazing and such a time saver! My morning routine is so easy now that I don't have to draw my eyebrows in! Tia is the best and makes you feel so comfortable during the process. And that new office....  It's gorgeous! If anybody is hesitant to do microblading.. don't be! It's awesome and don't go to anyone other then Tia! She is the best of the best!",5
E4UEsCcFScWKXmQb_4G28w,"Honestly my apartment is really nice and the maintenance could not be better, the food storage and other storage in the apartment are pretty compact, but that's city living. Also the people at the office are very nice and understanding. They always greet with a smile and great attitude.

Now for the cons... 

A lot of the people who live here (as you can tell by other reviews) think that the world revolves around them. I have received multiple complaints for absolutely nothing. They have changed the hours on some of the amenities thanks to people complaining so much. There is a rule that pets cannot use the artificial grass to use the bathroom which is understandable. Now whenever you walk through the courtyards with a pet there are people taking pictures of you in order to complain. People also fly around the parking garage in the wrong lane and scream out the window when you are in the correct lane. Also people park their vehicles in the visitor parking in order to not have to pay $50 for an extra spot, so the other day when I had a guest over there was no parking thanks to residents who live here parking in the guest spots. Also at night the hallways and courtyards smell strongly of marijuana.

I have met some very nice people here also who could not be more kind and helpful. But to the people who complain every time the wind blows and crickets chirp. RELAX!!!!!! You live with hundreds of other people all around you here, there will be noise, this is an apartment complex, not a library.

Update: The parking situation has gotten ridiculous. Guest Parking is now completely taken by residents. When I have guests come over there is no parking because the same people have been parking there for months! Management pretends to care then does nothing.",2

v-niYVEvN8_U3l4a4PZsiw,"Never. Again. My fiance and I almost walked out on this place after we ordered our food. The service was deplorable and the wait staff is full of invalid excuses as to why it takes almost an hour to get food out to a dining room that had a total of 6 tables. ""It's pretty hectic in here"" was an excuse given to me by one of the waitresses. Sorry, I used to Bust. My. Ass. when I was a server at a Mexican restaurant and I got food out to 10+ tables faster than this place can serve one!

I don't want to rag too much, because I did tell them I felt as though the service was sub-par. What could have helped the long wait? Simply our waitress coming to our table and at least checking on us once and letting us know the food was taking longer than usual. But that didn't happen. Then the table behind us asked for a manager and actually complained to them about the heinously long wait. Our waitress was nice, but not a good server.

My fiance and I were sat in a sparsely populated dining room and after we were sat - NO ONE ELSE CAME IN. No other tables were sat after us the whole time we waited around for our sub-par breakfast food, which came out luke warm by the way. How the hell can my food come out luke-warm when I've been waiting on it for 45 minutes?!

I ordered the Southwestern Eggs Benedict, which is basically eggs benedict with chorizo sausage. It was okay. It came with some pretty bland country potatoes. My fiance got The Crepe Dealer, which came with eggs, two strawberry crepes, and a ham steak which he declared to be too dry to eat. He had about three bites and for my fiance that is very weird.

Stay away from this place.",1

At poolside last night we were treated to live guitar music and singing from the Wigwam Bar area. To top it off we just finished a delicious breakfast served to us outside at the same bar. We have never received our food so promptly, we had settled in for a long wait and were pleasantly surprised. Stay here, you will love it!",5

Ordered the haymaker brunch meal - food portions were incredible small, bacon tasted awful, eggs seemed undercooked, and the restaurant doesn't allow for you to substitute out one of the side items.

If you're looking for a quality brunch, walk a couple blocks to either the famous toastery or the Rhino Market.",1

We arrived just before the dinner rush, and were able to be seated immediately. The decor is tacky Chinese-with red lanterns hanging throughout the restaurant. 

Just wanting to grab a snack, we shared 12 of the bok choy and pork boiled dumplings. I'm assuming that the dumplings are made to order so we had to wait a bit before the food arrived. 

Then, a heaping plate of freshly boiled dumplings arrived. I was pretty excited to try it out, getting myself prepared with the soy, vinegar, and the sriracha. Dipping the dumpling into the sauces, I took a bite. 

The skin wasn't too thick, the filling was flavorful, and there was also a bit of soup within. The pork wasn't too fatty, but there was a lack of bok choy, which I would have preferred to have more of. These weren't the best dumplings I've ever had, but they were good. 

So, whenever you're craving dumplings, it's surely the perfect comfort food on a cold winter day.",3

Keep in mind that the address I use is a mailing address.  I still have this mailing address.  Last week I switched all of our services over to Cox because I found out that Centurylink told me that I needed a home telephone in order to have internet services.  So for 2 years I paid $50 a month too much because I was lied to by the salesperson at Centurylink.  And the madness doesn't stop there.  Today I received a call from a collection agency saying I owed $107.94 from two years ago.  Since I still have that mailing address you would think that if I owed this money I would have received a bill from Centurylink!  But NOOOO they waited until I cancelled my services and then immediately sent me to collections for some bogus bill thats due although I was with them for 3 years and never missed a bill!!!!!!  You guys suck and are terrible.  I called Centurylink and billing told me she doesn't even know whats its for but to go ahead and pay it so my credit isn't ruined!  Again Centurylink sucks!!!!!!!

We had a front row seat at the bar facing the kitchen, so we were able to see the chefs cook and all the food coming out. It was a great experience however after a 6 Hour drive from New York, I would've preferred a table. However, this was not the restaurant that I intended to go to for dinner so I did not make a reservation thinking that it would not be too crowded at 5:45 PM. Boy was I wrong, all tables were reserved so we took seats at the bar and by the time we left the line was out the door.
Food was good, the tartare was phenomenal and the service was excellent but I really don't see the hype. But then again, I should've found out what boudin was before ordering it. I saw a tart, saw foie, and I was sold. I didn't realize it was a tart made up of blood sausage. I don't like blood sausage and the tart itself was way too salty. 
The pork shank was way too salty as well, however the risotto was perfectly cooked. 
I would give this place another try if I had opportunity, I feel I ordered all the wrong dishes. The duck in a can looked really interesting and the hen stuffed with offal and foie sounded pretty amazing, but since we're only in Montreal for 3 days, not going to happen.",3

There was a fun band there that was rocking it out all night.  I love loud music, however, it got a little too loud at times. All part of the experience, right?! The staff was very friendly and took time to answer our questions. Perfect small bar menu of food choices. We ordered 4 different items off the menu. The beef and onion sliders were very flavorful. Chicken and waffles were awesome, however wish the waffles were a little crispier. The grilled cheese sandwich was yummy- it had spinach and was pressed in a waffle iron, and the Cheetos that came with it were extra special with some spicy flavoring. The tempura onion rings were perfectly seasoned, but wish they were a big crispier as well. The onion ring and chicken and waffles were service on drum stick planks. Cool touch.

fGFFPtRM3aQ-wX5ucjyMxg,"This is Blueberry Hills newest location. They took over and remodeled the old Marie Callendar's building. It looks great inside now. Very modern and clean. Casual atmosphere.  I think this is the first BH with a small bar area. 

If you're looking for a real ""old school"" breakfast, this is the place. Best pancakes in town plus a wide variety of bacon, eggs, sausage, hash browns and the well-known blueberry muffins (I usually get a couple to go).

They have plenty of good lunch and dinner items, too. Turkey dinner is a favorite and burgers, too. I'd probably go here more often if they had Salmon, Prime Rib or maybe even a Ribeye steak but that's just me. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of items to choose from.

The desserts, especially the chocolate cake, are delicious. They have several specials every day, too.

Plus they have good parking despite being on one of Las Vegas's busiest streets - Flamingo. I still like the BH on Decatur, too.",4
97J8SBJaW0mdGJEY4k5dEQ,My friends really wanted to try their surf and turf pho - rib eye and lobster. They thought the flavor was good and liked the combo. I opted for the oxtail pho. My bowl was tasty as the flavors from the oxtail made it great.  I liked how the meat was cooked and easily comes off the bone. We also ordered the oxtail fries and the beef salad. The fries almost reminded me of poutine fries. They were a bit soggy as the juices/gravy soaked in them. The beef salad was good as the beef was very tender (I wished the pieces were a bit better).,4

Over the years I usually only had jeans and bottoms done but about a month ago i needed my bridesmaid dress altered. Now this dress wasn't a normal dress. It was like a formal gown. 6 layers of fabric which the fabric was Tule which is not easy.  Had to be hemmed all layers, the back & front and to be taken in and a little on the side. A lot of work on this dress. I picked it up and it fit perfectly. Her and her husband that own the ship are so nice and the most humble people you will ever meet.

H5EJNsagcb7AKDzZquCfyA,"I have maintained an account with Wachovia (now Wells Fargo) for many years. 

It's only in the past year that I've begun to question how much longer I'll continue to do so. Especially since I have accounts at a few other financial institutions and I haven't had any problems with those businesses.

My experience inside this branch was so-so. I stood in a long line and made my deposit at a teller station that was too close to the line and too close to the other teller stations for any privacy that may be required during a bank transaction.

But I think I can say that about every Wachovia (now Wells Fargo) location that I've ever been in. 

My teller greeted me professionally enough, helped me complete my transaction, bid me farewell, and wished me a good weekend. (It was a Friday.)

Later in the evening, I was surprised to get an e-mail notification about my deposit AND my withdrawal. 

I immediately checked my account online and sure enough, there was a line that said I had made a withdrawal in a branch or store. Which I knew I had NOT. And why would I, when I had deposited CASH? (The money was withdrawn at the same branch I made my deposit which is why I am writing the review under this branch. I have another issue that happened at another branch that I will review under that branch.)

I called the 24-hour customer service line, explained the situation and was told that the customer service rep had had a similar call earlier.

She then asked me if I knew someone named A______ M_______. (I do not. And even if I did, how would A_______ M_______ withdraw from my account if she is not a joint account holder?)

Suspicious to say the least.

While I cannot say for sure that my teller was at fault for this mishap, she was the person who accessed my information. Is it possible that she didn't close out my file when my transaction was completed, allowing further access to my account?

They wouldn't divulge that information which I can understand but don't appreciate.

It took the bank a week to investigate and return the funds to my account.

Thankfully there were no overdrafts due to this unpleasant occurrence.


Note: This branch is now a Wells Fargo Bank, like the all the former Wachovia Banks here in Charlotte.",1
W5NpRQaTcp10gdp3TAz38g,One of my favourite food places on Yonge. Their signature udon is really good and their cocktail menu is a must-try. Atmosphere is good inside but it could get pretty packed in the evening so it is best to make reservations ahead of time.,4
Gy80y4_qADlep_PoesWtrw,"I really do enjoy my time every time I come here. This establishment reminds me of being back east, with its ambiance and vibe. I came here last week for my birthday and with good drinks, good food, and good company, I had a blast!! We had the crab dip, fish n chips, and bangers and mash. All of the food was quite delicious! What I like most about the open in the crowd. Yes, it is in Scottsdale, but it's not Scottsdale. The people who come here are down to earth, and not the uppity uptight pretentious people of Scottsdale, which I love. When you're here, you're family and everyone is willing to talk to everyone. And even the waitstaff is friendly and attentive. I wish I could frequent this place more often but I live rather far away. I will never have a problem if a friend suggests coming here for a night of drinking!!",4

VERY VERY DECEIVING! So the shrimp was not up to par and most of the meats were average to say the best. The bar was ok, service was not anything special either.

ngPABr58785am1TbAXVBNA,"While visiting Toronto, this experience was sort of icing on the cake for us.

At 19 were crazy enough to drive to drive the 9 hour ride through the entire state of NY...pretty much to sit down at a bar and have a drink! Seriously, before we even got there, I didn't even know anything about the CN tower. I can recall seeing the structure miles away and quickly had to search to see what that was.

We were also crazy enough to go during the middle of winter, so we had NO wait lines at all compared to what others have stated. I'm sure lines are much longer during the Spring and Summer. Nothing at all like the 4 hours to see the Empire State Building. Within 5 minutes of walking in, we were on the elevator (which is partially glass so you watch yourself go up) and it is very fast. Your ears will pop going up, much like an airline experience does, so be prepared. 

The glass floor isn't the entire floor, but I didn't think it would be. Too many people would panic and my partner wouldn't even go close to it. 

Overall, the CN tower was a neat experience that I will never forget, and those sort of moments are worth more than the pieces of paper it cost me.",5
KfbKzNBcA4320aJEbKD8sA,"Great place if you are a chocolate lover or craving for some. Friendly and quick service, but a little pricy. Great place to chill with friends as the staff don't rush you or make you feel pressured to leave. Many available and comfy seatings. 

Interesting fondu flavours like the Earl Grey Chocolate, very smooth and full of aroma. 
Disappointed that the cup of fondue looks a lot bigger than it actually is, very deceiving as the content is actually only a few table spoons, less than 1/3 of the cup. Would be a lot better if there is more dip and enough for all the items in the set.

Their signature hot chocolate is a die for, but quite pricy. Worth a try though as you probably wouldn't find anything like it elsewhere. It is extremely thick and filling, best to be shared.

Brunch menu on the pricy side. The chicken waffle is more like a waffle chicken salad sandwich. Fluffy waffle, but nothing too special. I prefer the chicken crunch. 

It is like another Demetres, just pricier and more options.",4

Second, Still other than the pricing an excellent job is done when I bring my truck in for routine maintenance.

The disappointment is, when the vehicles get the complimentary car wash, it comes out with water not dried by the blowers from the car wash. So now when I drive home, because I was not prepared to dry the truck, I get water spots.  Maybe I should be better prepared and bring me some towels with me to dry off the water before leaving.

_AStrkJS6wauYeexeOoP0A,"My new favorite restaurant is Jac's. 

To be fair, the pool of restaurants in Madison that I can actually eat at has narrowed considerably of late, due to a diagnosis of Celiac disease. The treatment for Celiac disease is a 100% gluten-free diet for the rest of my life. Unlike someone with a gluten intolerance, I cannot eat at places where there is a significant risk of cross-contamination, so a lot of Madison's ""gluten-free"" menus are not feasible for me, because they are not truly gluten-free.

 I am IN LOVE with Jac's because I feel the risk of gluten cross-contamination is really low, and that makes me feel comfortable to eat there. First of all, they maintain a dedicated fryer for gluten-free fried items. This is essential for me, and is actually, I am finding, quite rare. Additionally, our waitress  was extremely knowledgeable and seemed to take my restriction seriously. Although she was ""pretty sure"" that none of the sauces on the menu contained gluten, she checked the items we ordered, specifically, to reassure me, and seemed happy to do so. Unrelated to gluten, the host was also awesome. We arrived to a bit of a wait, and he allowed us to walk up and down Monroe St. during our 15 minute wait. He called us when our table was ready. That was such a nice touch.

On to the food. The gluten-free menu options at Jac's are extensive. There are several menu items with a tiny ""g"" next to them. In my naivete, I initially assumed the ""g"" denoted menu items that were gluten-free. This seemed more standard, as most places don't offer that many GF (gluten-free) options. Our waitress informed me, however, that the tiny ""g"" denotes only the few menu items that CANNOT be ordered GF! That meant that nearly the entire menu was my Oyster! With so many choices, it took a while  to pick my dish. I finally settled on the GF Tarte Flambe. The Tarte Flambe was a flatbread topped with Jones Farm Bacon, Caramelized Onions, Creme Fraiche, rosemary, and Parmesan Cheese. It tasted heavenly. I can only describe the taste as being the same as the glorious smell of bacon and onions cooking together (plus cheese). It was SO. GOOD. And, the gluten-free crust was thin and crisp, and it had no discernible ""weird"" flavor or texture. We also had gluten-free frites with four amazing gluten free dipping sauces. Everything about it was incredible. 

Although my experience was awesome, I can anticipate it being really hard to get a table at Jac's on a weekend night. We went on a Tuesday at around 7pm, and there was STILL a wait! They don't take reservations on Fridays, which is disappointing. I will definitely dine at Jac's again, and I look forward to writing an updated review at some point.",5

sFeqK2C2yj9QEvdTJhFxrg,"I've been here several times and it has always just been mediocre, service and the food.  Service is hit or miss.  And we all know that I'm not crazy about chains, but sometimes they are most convenient.  

I came for Easter Sunday and did the call ahead seating, so I called about 40 minutes in advance for a party of two.  When we arrived, we were seated right away.  The server was new and a little slow, but there wasn't a rush or anything, so it was fine.  I am giving the four stars because this experience was the best one so far.  I had the steak and lobster and the steak was phenomenal.  I was extremely surprised at how wonderful it was.  It was a filet and cooked medium well (don't judge).  It melted in my mouth.

However we waited. They came over to the table after about 20min after ordering and dropped out check. I said ""we haven't gotten out food yet"". The girl said sorry we forgot to send it in and that she would rush it. Two more times we had this talk and at the end of the hour still no even started on our food. We went up to say we are out and they said...ok, bye. I'm big on customer service since that's my job and this here was a lack of paying attention and making it right.

pZ8j3j2fysgcc6Vknz5ybg,"My experience with Party People was awesome.  I see other reviews saying they received poor customer service, but I have know idea what they are talking about.  My husband and I got married in October of 2017, and we used Party People to supplies tent frames, tables, chairs, linens, wooden benches, wooden dining tables, bistro lights, and a 20kw portable generator.  We had a great experience, as everything was delivered on time, picked up on time, and set up and torn down very efficiently.

On top of that, Cathy, one of the owners of the business, was so helpful!  My husband planned most of the layout, setup, and logistics of the weeding.  Cathy was willing to meet him on Saturdays and take a lot of time to talk through order forms and logistics, ensuring that the right sizes and best options for every detail of the wedding were rented and making the wedding look perfect!  Cathy was even willing to deliver our rental items a day earlier than normal at no extra charge so that we had plenty of time to get everything setup and decorated and not be stressed out leading up to the wedding.  

This was so different from a few other companies we had talked with when determining who to get our rentals from.  The other companies simply didn't care about us as customers because we weren't some large, corporate account.  Party People, on the other hand, is a small business run by a group of siblings, and they listened to us, worked with our vision, and went above and beyond.

I loved my experience with Party People.  I give them a solid 5 stars and will be recommending them to anyone I know with any rental needs!",5
qQMWWVHgmBtVkoExePLbrg,"The Farmer's Market is the only good reason to be up early on a Saturday morning.  And I do mean early.  I mean, like, 7 a.m.  Get there much later than that and you have to contend with throngs of slightly dazed people, and a lot more women pushing strollers that you inevitably trip over.

Do yourself a big favor and stop at the Oakhouse Bakery tent for *amazing* scones and other such pastries.  Get your cured meat fix at the D&G tent, where incredible beef jerky abounds.  Hook's Cheese is another favorite of mine, with many varieties of aged cheddar and jack.

Kgo5TDvykkgyQ3rHoYwoSQ,"Visit Date: 3/10/2018

First time here after all the Hype around Charlotte about this place 

FOOD & SERVICES: I had the C-Port Platter for $40 with extra butter sauce. IT WAS REALLY GOOD!! OMG WAS IT GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now I was gonna eat it the restaurant. It was a very long wait for my food which I understand. BUT when I got my food, parts of my crabs was cold and the shrimp was mins away from also being cold, I don't mind waiting for my food because I know it's freshly cooked BUT WHEN MY FOOD COMES AND ITS NOT HOT AND I HAVE WAITED 30 MINS PLUS FOR MY FOOD THATS A PROBLEM. Mind you at that time I was going to dine in. The waitress took my food back to warm it back up and I asked her to just bag it up to go. The service to the table is a bit slow. I don't think each service have certain tables because about 2 to 3 different PPL stop it my table and asked have someone helped(which is a good thing). Now would I go back ......YES I WILL HANDS DOWN! I HAVE ALREADY PLANNED THE DATE LOL. Hopefully things will be better. Everyone have off days. 


INSIDE: it's pretty big and they have their logo on all the tables. It's a pretty good vibe. They have a good music playing. Yes the lines are long. When I got there it was just like 5 people ahead of me BUT when I was leaving (around 3:30 ish) that line was OUT THE DOOR! They also have a stage. I wonder if they have ppl preforming there sometimes? 

THE PROCESS: You pay for your food at front when you walked in (thats why the line is long like that). It would be helpful if it's your first time, to look at the menu before getting there, so it will help the line move faster. After you pay, the host will take you to your table. Then you will get your food. Now the food is cooked when your order. So keep in mind that it's not fast food. If you are in a rush you might want to call in your order and get it to go. They will bring your food in a Togo box (yes even if you dine in). Which is cool especially if you don't eat all your food. 

TOGO ORDER: YES YOU STILL HAVE TO STAND IN THAT LINE. BUT YOU WILL GO TO THE BAR TO PICKUP YOUR ORDER.",4

I told her I couldn't physically make it I was that sick and she said well we will send you collections. Horrible customer service I can't believe how they treat their  patients. They had no empathy at all and they aren't willing to work with you at all. Beware is all I can say! They are supposed to help people not make them feel worse. I asked the girl so you want me to drive to my appointment being in my current condition and risk getting into an accident because I'm sick so I won't be charged the 150.00 she said no I didn't say that but we are still going to charge you.

FpkNdoAGP6mIcYw_i8HHqg,"In 2011, I leased my first mini convertible.  I LOVED the car.  It was a blast to drive and unless it was raining, I had to roof down.  Last week I went to the dealership, as my lease was near the end.  While I would have preferred to get another mini convertible, due to health challenges, I had to get something larger and more practical for my needs.  

I met with Alexa, who was great.  She found several vehicles for me to test drive and I ended up purchasing a pre-owned, one-owner vehicle perfect for me.

I am NOT the kind of customer who will sit around for hours playing the game of ""let me go ask my manager.""  When I'm shopping for a vehicle I expect the person I'm dealing with to be given the opportunity to do what it takes without having to run and ask for permission.  Alexa was professional, enthusiastic and knowledgeable.  In a word, fabulous.

While this is my second time getting a vehicle from Mini, it won't be my last.  So, if you are looking to lease or purchase a Mini Cooper or a pre-owned vehicle, I highly recommend Mini of Las Vegas on Sahara.  And be sure to ask for Alexa Dolpies.  Tell her Vona sent you.",5

e6TG28SoLShfdbmvIZeZnA,"The food is 4 stars and the beer is more of a 3.5. 

There are days when I'm starving and wishing I could drive the six hours to Phoenix and have Four Peaks for lunch. I don't know why, but the food there is tops for a brewpub. It's not super gourmet like those participating in this gastropub movement as of late, but it's solid comfort all the way. I'm particularly addicted to their beer-battered chicken tenders and their fries (seasoned wedges) are like crack. They've got decent fish and chips (although they don't hold a candle to George and Dragon) and the other stuff's good too. 

Beer-wise, Four Peaks doesn't make the cut on my list of favorite breweries in the country, but for Arizona, it's okay. The Kiltlifer (not to be confused with Moylan's Kilt Lifter (which rates higher on BeerAdvocate) from California, and the less popular Pike's Kilt Lifter from Seattle, seems to be their most popular brew and is a pretty standard and consistent Scotch ale with just the right amount of malt and yeast. 

Other offerings include their 8th Street Ale (average), Hefeweizen (below average), and their Hop Knot IPA (which is inconsistent-- sometimes it's very hoppy, sometimes it's just got no bite at all). They have a Raja IPA which is also inconsistent-- sometimes it has no difference from the Hop Knot whatsoever, but when you do get a batch that tastes different, it's a little comparable to Lagunitas'  Hop Stupid. 

The Oatmeal Stout and Pumpkin Porter are laughable. Just cheap knock offs of better breweries, although the Stout does make a decent milkshake. And the Arizona Peach used to be a summer fave of mine up until I got a pint that tasted entirely of wheat...gross. 

It gets packed here, but they've got tons of space and a decent happy hour. Tons of Tempe locals, but worth the visit if you're in the area. Is this the best local brewery in the greater Phoenix area? Of course...but there isn't really much competition, now is there?",4

The bread used for the toast was so delicious that I woke up thinking about it the next day. The array of jams and jellies that they serve are pure perfection. In the end, my husband and I ended up buying two jars (one raspberry the other apricot) to take home with us. 

There was only 1 waitress there that day. She put most big named restaurants to shame. She was sweet, attentive, and was able to work the whole room (all filled with locals that frequented the place daily).

Nothing glamorous, just your average diner with average food. But, with it being one of the few spots in the QC open 24 hours, how can you go wrong? Automatic bonus points for that and more bonus points for them serving fried chicken and mac 'n cheese alllllll damn day! Can I get an Amen?!",3

I was forced to pay 80 dollars for 2 pieces of meat. I was by passed continuously by waiters and did not receive quality service, compared to the tables of white diners sitting behind me. In the severs defense some people in my party had already closed out, but they are suppose to check for the green flip cards. I was served 2 pieces of meat in 2 hrs. I was offered the same meat four times. 
I came with intentions of eating a full meal, and left hungry after spending 2hrs at this restaurant . Worst experience of my life. Spoke with every member of management to try and rectify the situation. Not even an apology, but instead they informed me that they couldn't tell how many pieces of meat I ate. Petty management and petty practices. Was treated like a run a way slave and called a liar. No respect or fucks were given and no reasonable solutions were offered. Once Told management the truth about how I felt and nothing was done. I was a man of my word, the check was 67.00,  I paid 80 dollars only because I was being forced to stay inside the restaurant  and I didn't want problems. I told the manager to his face that I no longer wanted to be in the restaurant after receiving such horrible service.  They wanted me to stay longer and finish my meal, but why would I when the service was already horrible.

WTDdvIZyQ2WUUKa0FpHRtQ,"First, Kim is a credit to LabCorp. I have been to this location a number of times and find her to be thorough, efficient, knowledgeable and friendly.  I went to a different LabCorp location (Spring Valley Hospital) recently and it was much busier, and the attendants seemed to hate their jobs.  The person who was helping me at that location was not friendly and seemed annoyed about everything. At Spring Valley, they seem fixated on getting people away from the desk as quickly as possible -- questions are an annoyance -- and every answer is followed by please have a seat and we'll call you up. As it turns out the computer was telling the attendant I was not eligible, which she couldn't explain. I have insurance coverage and LabCorp is within my network so that was a confusing situation. After hearing that, I asked what the tests would cost -- just a ballpark -- if I had to pay for them and she really couldn't say. I won't go back to the Spring Valley Hospital location. I took the paperwork and made an appointment at West Sunset instead. Kim was so on the ball, she noticed the Spring Valley attendant had missed the code for one of the tests I was supposed to have.  As it turns out, there was no ""not eligible"" warning via the computer system and there was just one other person waiting for a test. (This location opens early and closes about 2 p.m., I believe. 
The first time I went to this location,  I must admit it was a little strange that there is no extra employee to handle ""intake"",while the others do blood draws.  So, Kim and the other employee will input all the information, take credit info, confirm address, etc. and then call you up to also conduct the blood draw.  I imagine it's LabCorps way to make more money by having employees do more than one job -- not necessarily doing it in the quickest way for the customer's benefit.",4

Mais, oui!  Ooh la la, Le Petit Triangel Cafe, Je t'aime.  

Picture this:
A warm spring evening with occasional rain, my date and I enter a warm, tiny French Cafe and suddenly I am no longer in Cleveland, but Paris.

Kate, our server was darling.  She made excellent suggestions and was attentive, but not overbearing.

We started with a ""Happy Hour"" special of Sangria.  Summer = Sangria.  Délicieux.  Then for Hors-d'oeuvre we enjoyed a wonderful cheese plate, which is a great bang for your buck, and escargot which were perfectly prepared.  Avec le dîner we enjoyed a wonderful bottle of wine.  Both of our main course selections were bon.  The quantity of food for the price is excellent.

Dessert was a Nutella Crepe and espresso.  My date and I were not overwhelmed by the crepe.  This is my one complaint.  It was a bit thick for what I consider a crepe.  Not terrible, just not extraordinaire.  The espresso was nice and oui, it came with la torsion de citron!

There is a quaint patio which I imagine I will frequent for an evening bottle of wine and cheese plate, or a croissant and cafe au lait on Sunday mornings.

Le Petit Triangle is a beautiful venue for a date.  Take your bien-aimé here.",5

Fleming's is pricier than pricy though and not really worth what you pay for.  Think ""meat on a plate"" with zero accoutrements.

qd0NB2aonSFzuT5OkarZ4g,"There was a long wait. According to other reviews, that's apparently always true.

As an appetizer, I paid $4 for a couple of egg rolls that were about four inches long and the diameter of a dime. Come on now, really. The miso soup and the cucumber salad appetizers were about $1.50 each, I observed those portions were much better matched to the price.

The AYCE deal at Yama Sushi was a few bucks cheaper than Sushi Kaya about ¼ mile up the street, but Sushi Kaya was somewhat better quality, and the service was a wee bit more attentive. 

Pho Kim Long is just a few doors away in the same strip mall as Yama Sushi. No ACYE sushi at Pho Kim Long, of course, but the product is much higher quality, a nice meal, with generous portions, and you'll get out easily for the same price.

I'd take either of those places again before Yama Sushi. But Pho Kim Long is the best choice of the three, by far.

uv5TBGcwQc3Pamcv20qkCw,"I really wanted to like Corbeaux. I have visited maybe once every month and a half since it opened on 17th.

 The concept is nice (and so's the massive skylight pouring natural light over the tables and walls) but at the same time it's all over the place. I visit 17th ave a lot and the building's exterior is pretty imposing; its spaciousness is reflected inside the building, but is taken advantage of pretty terribly. The layout itself is confusing, with dining tables on one side of a divider and a counter where you can order baked goods. I'm never sure where you're allowed to sit, so it kind of defeats the purpose of trying to blend the line between an all-purpose hangout place and a formal dining experience. I might try having dinner there one day, but I don't know - it never really appealed to me as a restaurant, so I never think about going there exclusively for a sit-down meal.

If you go to Corbeaux to study, you're basically relegated to the stools by the windows, which is not actually the best feeling, even though it's basically the same thing as Analog. The first few times I went when it opened, it seemed like a fledgling operation, trying to find it's feet - the cashiers by the baked goods were inexperienced and it took forever just to get a chocolate eclair. Having the cashier also handling all of the retrieving, sandwich-warming and whatnot all while managing the till is really inefficient and it definitely makes you feel impatient just watching. Though the eclair itself was good, I don't get a hampering for sweets and their sandwiches often enough to go regularly. 

I don't think Corbeaux is the coolest thing that ever was - the execution is actually quite confusing and I have no idea what the areas/stools at the back are for. It just seems like a lot of wasted space and it could be more cohesive. 

In terms of the food I've tried, the cookies were okay, but didn't seem that fresh. I like eggplants, so got an eggplant sandwich. It was VERY oily, leaking all over my hands and was definitely inconveniencing when I had to get up from my stool and walk straight up to the cashier to try to find paper napkins. They were pretty judge-y about that (I'm sry???? my hands are covered in oil someone help). The sweets are high quality, macaroons slightly disappointing... but overall, just not a phenomenal experience for what it appears to offer.",2
VIRx5ycEhPTNqVdph8F9NA,"DO NOT ORDER FOOD! 
My husband and I went with two other couples and we were all looking forward to being able to have a meal and drink some drinks all while watching a movie in some comfy seats. We all left disappointed and said we wouldn't go back. 
First, the movie didn't start on time. Not too big of a deal because there were no previews, but that was just the beginning of the downfall. 
Second, we ordered our food at 8:00. By 8:45, my husband and I were still waiting on our glass of water and food. By this time the other people we came with had already finished their food, which came to them cold. By 9:00, after repeating what we had ordered, our food arrived. We were lucky that it came warm. About 30 mins after that we were brought our food again....and then, as the credits rolled, a server came dashing up the stairs to bring us yet another order. It was craziness. 
One person from our group noticed that the same servers for our theater were also working all the other theaters too!! It's no wonder why food was late and cold! 
Lastly, the girls bathroom was so gross. The trash was spilling out the top of the garbage hole in the counter. Some of the stalls had ZERO toilet paper! 
In conclusion, if you are looking to have dinner AND a movie, don't. Eat before or after the movie, unless you're cool paying for over priced, cold food. 
This place needs better management if it intends to stay in business.",1

tGyXJUvI9Uwukolx6SwSqw,"FOCACCIA SANDWICHES ARE A MUST HAVE. Like seriously... get it. and don't split it. Me and my friend made this mistake. Don't do it. It's also a very reasonable price for this amazing, oily, fluffy delicious sandwich. We got the only vegetarian variety (sorry forgot the name) - and it was honestly bomb. 

As for other things, my friend got the angel hair pasta (~$16) and I got the baby octopus (~$14 I think). The portions were pretty small, but my baby octopus was very fresh and flavourful. My friend enjoyed her pasta but thought it was quite oily (especially since our sandwich was pretty much drenched in oil as well aha). To be honest, we both kinda wished we just got two sandwiches... cause they were THAT good. 

Lastly the service was great, the waiter was perfectly attentive and the ambiance was nice was well. Overall I'd say 4.5",5

ttDpEi84vz2ZP5H6n8xZAg,"I was really impressed with this place.  It's right around the corner, which means I can pop over any time I need a new pair of shoes, and I received awesome service the day I went.

I was shopping around for a new shoe... I've tried a few pairs over the past year but hadn't found anything I really liked.  I was the only customer in the store, and the sales guy put me on the treadmill and did a quick gait analysis, which was very helpful.  He trotted out a whole line of shoes for my footstrike and encouraged me to take them out for a run on the pavement since I'm mostly an outdoor runner.  I ended up finding a great shoe (Asics Gel Lendrem 6) and have loved running in it for the past few weeks.

The prices seem a little more than I would pay online or at a larger retailer, but I think it's worth it for the service.  After all, now that I've found a shoe I really like, I can just order it online from now on.",4
quoLn0cXmg8nhs9S3dmSsQ,"When one sees the name Elegance Chinese Cuisine, one expects to walk into a restaurant full of elegance, otherwise why own a name like that?  We went there on a weeknight and naturally it was probably a little bit more quiet than usual.  There were only ten tables that I could see that were occupied so finding a seat that evening wasn't a problem at all.

We wanted to try some of their more delicate dishes so we went with their Peking Duck skin and wrap, A Stir Fried Lobster with Ginger, Steamed Baby Bok Choys and Shrimp Mixed with Tofu and Egg White Sauce.

Traditionally the Peking Duck will always arrive first as they will skin the duck in front of you and that it is often used as an appetizer  The duck skin was crispy and the duck meat was marinated well and had just the right amount of fat in it.  The wraps were hot and plentiful as no extra wraps were needed.

The rest of the duck meat was diced and brought back out so that it could be used as the main ingredient for the wraps.  The tradition use of hoisin sauce and green onions along with their cabbage wraps made this a much more enjoyable dish to have.    

The lobster was comparable to its competitors.  The meat was tender and the sauce was able to penetrate into the meat making all the lobster meat succulent and delicious.  

The two vegetable and fungi dishes were simple, tasty and were a good compliment with all the meat dishes that we had ordered that evening.  Despite the amount of egg white sauce in the latter dish, the shrimp remained tender and fresh.     

Overall, the dishes were all pretty good.  The dishes were fresh, colorful and plentiful to go all the way around.  Staff was always by our side although that could have been the fact that it was a quiet weeknight at the restaurant.   Prices were reasonable for the quality of the food that was presented. Dim sum I'm told is pretty good here so the next time I visit, we will try some dim sum at this place and report back to you.  Dinner overall was satisfactory with plenty of smiles all around the table.",4

vICB7uZO7pCvP2rv1CKjBQ,"I love coming to Gordon Square, and I previously considered this to be a pretty good option for cheaper eats in the area. We've gobbled up some pretty decent food here before - one of the first times I had chicken and waffles was at XYZ, and I still remember arguing with my husband because he was the one that ordered it and I was eating too much of his meal. Good food is worth arguing about, right? 

After our last visit, I don't know what to think! Their prices have gone up (the chicken and waffles was definitely not $10.75 last time we had it) and I guess they just decided they were too cool for salt and pepper. I had butternut squash gnocchi which was supposed to be in a brown butter sauce topped with parmesan. The dumplings were chewy and flavorless, and appeared to have just been rolled in some olive oil. No cheese...no nothing. I wanted to ask our waiter if I could get some cheese but he never stopped long enough at our table for me to mention it. My husband also got grits as a side and again, completely bland. Cheese is one of the things I wake up for every day, so the lack of it on my pasta and in the grits seriously bummed me out. My sister ordered their fried broccoli appetizer, which was pretty tasty, although they don't cut up the broccoli stalks at all beforehand so some of the batter between florets doesn't end up getting cooked. 

They offer a lot of drink specials depending on the day. Before 7 on weekdays they have a few draft beers for $3 (when we went it was Rebel IPA, LH Milk Stout and Brooklyn Lager). A pretty good deal for decent beers, but our Brooklyn Lagers tasted a bit off. Like not clean tap lines. Sadness. Anyway, I know this place has potential so I'm not about to give up on it, but my expectations are definitely lower now!",3

VXcmSq0CZae3LJVmm31jgA,"This review is years overdue. I forget Yelp is for businesses beyond restaurants at times.

I'm obsessed with the Phoenix Knife House. I need to go there every once in a while just to hang out (and I always have to buy something). I've bought many a present here and I'm always itching to buy another knife for the house. 

Phoenix Knife House carries Japanese chef's knifes - which are only sharpened on one side. They're ridiculously sharp and so cool. We have a killer set of Wusthof's that we got for a wedding present that we don't really use anymore. And we just have a few knives from PKH. While we don't need anymore really, I have to get another soon. I'm going for the Sugimoto 8"" chef's knife.

While they have some amazing, high end works of art (Damascus steel & such), they also carry a good selection of great knives that are super affordable.

Eytan, the owner, carries knives in typical Western shape and traditional Japanese form. He also has a bunch of killer kitchen tools. Absolutely love the kitchen shears he told us to get long ago and was excited to pick up a nice fish spatula recently.

This happens to be the place where many of the valley's local chefs do their knife shopping. Eytan has also expanded to carry some additional chef supplies so head over there if you need a chef's coat or clogs as well.

In addition to being an authority on knives, he's a master sharpener. He sharpens all kinds of knives, is super reasonable and has a quick turnaround.

In addition to the awesome product he has, Eytan is a major foodie. He is a former chef (SCI grad I think?) who worked at amazing places like Kai, Circa 1900, opened Fiamma here and did time in New York at spots like Aureole, La Côte Basque, and Craft.

He is also a great guy and a wealth of information on the local food scene. I'm always following up on  his recommendations.

Even if you have nice knives, you should check it out. Might get converted like I did!",5

Two stars for the African American gentleman working the counter and the assistant manager my fiancé spoke  to after I had an issue with a return they were both polite and understanding. When I have a receipt for my purchase and the bank card that matches the original purchase I find it very uncomfortable and a privacy violation to ask for my identification. This wasn't just a glance but a full on writing information down, studying my ID like a criminal, then taking my personal information and typing it all in to their system. For an 11 dollar return that i had the original receipt for as well as the debit card it was purchased on. If I didn't have a receipt or had 100 dollars worth of product then I would understand. Cashier had a ""that's the way it is"" attitude and couldn't give me a clear explanation of why she was doing what she was.

zTl0Ea7fMvxu73gl1XbNnw,"Echo & Rig is one of those restaurants that doesn't get as much attention as it deserves. They are located in Tivoli Village here in Summerlin. Yet for some reason when I tell people that actually live in the area about Echo, they say things like ""did it just open"" or they'll ask ""is it brand new"" which always makes me wonder what kind of advertising they do if any. Anyway this place is fun. They have a nice atmosphere, a good crowd and are always consistent. Ok things to try: Start with the Cauliflower it's prepared with Chili de Arbol, Crispy Shallots & Onions. They are very good. I also like the Brussel Sprouts which are made with Pistachio & Fresh Lemon. For Fish entrées you must try two. First the Organic King Salmon made with carrot puree, bloomsdale spinach, garlic, lemon and olive oil. Second is the Horseradish Crusted Butterfish with roasted root vegetables & tarragon pinot sauce both are very good but the Butterfish is my top pick. Now for the meats. I would say you can't go wrong with any but my three pics are The Spencer Steak, The Filet Tenderloin and lastly my favorite The Jumping Beef which is made with filet mignon tips, roasted tomatoes, red onions, crispy potatoes & Peruvian demi-glace, very good. No matter what you choose it'll be good they are doing a good job. If you are a Summerlin local and haven't been, then hop over to Tivoli and step into Echo & Rig for a bite!",4

DCLcCkOss-SfBp4kcxZRHQ,"I wasn't super impressed with anything here. 

Food: Food was good but pretty basic. I got the big cheesy melt and two tacos.

Service: First when we walked up there was no host. I think the person that sat us was technically off-shift at the time. Kind of odd. Our server checked in about the right amount. Table over from us got upset that they weren't getting their check fast enough. Someone at the host desk (some guy) later came over and started brow-beating the bar staff from the host table. Meaning - yelling over to them from about 20 feet away about how they weren't working. Super unprofessional and awkward and I honestly was waiting for Jon Taffer of Bar Rescue to pop out of a corner and start yelling at people about how unprofessional they were being and how uncomfortable they were making their guests.

Drinks: Fiance ordered the frozen margarita flight and I ordered the La Casuela signature margarita that was said to be served in a special bowl and made table-side. Her flight was good. She said it was too strong but I liked them a lot. She still drank them all. LOL. My margarita was sub-par. My fiance also pointed out that it said on the menu that they made it at your table - they did not do that. Flavor of this margarita was very muted and certainly nothing special. For being the most expensive margarita on their menu... it was a huge disappointment.

Verdict: There are far better taco joints within a 2 mile radius that you can go to and enjoy better service, food, and drinks.",3

Whatever the reason, Oodle Noodle have fresh udon. They have traditional dishes and fusion dishes. The fusion dishes are ones that incorporate ingredients like kim chi or cheese that aren't typically found in Japanese udon dishes.

Park Lawn and Queensway,  I've heard this place has always maintained it quality for simple, hearty and flavorful home cooked Italian food. The decor is very reminiscing of Italy with the statues outside, oak wood interior decor with the small bar, light fixtures, pictures and wine racks ;)
Though there was a small line, a lot of people do take out here, and their service is very efficient and their portions are satisfying along with their prices.
In terms of food my friend and I had:

-house wine red /white glass was only $5.50. ..cheap!
-Calamari lightly fried and easy on the batter. Not over salted. Served with homemade marinara sauce which isn't overly acidic. Which I'd say was a 4.5/5
-Garlic bread,  hearty, not overdosed with garlic,  however slightly burnt edges 2.5/5
- large Pizza,  gourmet cheesy and lots of ingredients. Prosciutto and pineapple, thin crust and just a gem of enjoyment. 4/5

CKJcc4Z_hGCh8vmk82uapA,"This place is as impossible to park as it is to make a choice on what to eat. Once you enter you are greeted with rows of rotisserie chicken (like a Swiss Chalet commercial) and neatly tiled pieces of meat and fish on the grill. There are literally tons of stuff being grilled right before your eyes and makes you wonder who is eating all that until you hit the line and realized apparently there are lots.

Everything looked fantastic and I wish I could try them all but of course I had to go with the Portuguese staple of a whole roasted chicken. This stuff is pretty tender and the flavours are decent. I can't say it's the best I've had but it's pretty darn good. I love the hot sauce and I make sure the chicken is well lathered with it. I do wish the chicken was a bit more flavourful though and it lacked that pronounced charred taste that makes it special (no, no burnt but more like a charcoal grill kinda taste). Probably because it wasn't grilled over charcoals like it is traditionally.

I am interested in heading back to try other stuff but I would say 3 stars is fair for now. Stop by if you are hungry because $9 gets you an entire chicken.",3

I'm part of the promotional team behind a custom knife show that happens every Labor Day Weekend at this hotel. PH had been so good to us over the years that I decided to stay here while I was in Vegas for the SHOT Show and UFC Fights.

Unfortunately my last stay was not so pleasant.

I was sent an email allowing me to check in online. I clicked the link and was told I would receive a text when I checked in. I got it before I boarded the plane. Pretty cool, huh?

Wait it gets worse.

The email told me to go to the ""Key Desk"" to pick up my keys. I disembarked the airport shuttle with some other people and went to the Key Desk. The desk jockey was talking to some idiot couple who were checking in like they were at the Registration Desk. I thought this was supposed to be an express check-in deal? Whatever.

Twenty five minutes later the people who rode with me were happily walking to their rooms while I was still waiting for this moron to tell these assholes from Iowa how to flush a toilet.

When he finally got to me, I was done in less than 3 minutes. As I walked away he called over the next person in line from registration. I shook my head in disgust wondering why they would have someone like this manning the express ""Key Desk"".

The weekend was over, I received my bill. These assholes charged me $22.40 for this ""convenience"" and refused to reverse the charges.

Went here on a Saturday morning around 9am... Hung around for about an hour, there was a constant line. This location is definitely a busy one, but the wait isn't terrible and they keep people moving. 

We were a group of 7, each with a drink and some sort of pastry/sandwich. I appreciate the barista at the register, who was friendly, helpful, and patient with us and our long order. 30 mins later when I went back in line to order something else, he still remembered my name, nice! 

So our drinks were Starbucks standards, I ordered an iced unsweetened green tea and a bacon/egg sandwich. The sandwich was heated nicely, the cheese melted... It had bacon but still tasted light, and not too heavy. My kid enjoyed a toasted bagel with cream cheese. 

A little messy though, probably because of the heavy traffic... But why was the outside of the food display SOOOOOO dusty?! Like a good layer of dust, really. It's very noticeable, and thick enough to assume that it's been there for a while... I also assume that it's on their ""to do"" list, to wipe down counters and display Windows.

nY5k-pFCSZMUhnE6BXc4iQ,"We were anticipating when this place would open. While in the area, we went inside- yay! It's like a spacious Buy/Sell version of Blockbuster and Game Stop mixed together (smaller than Zia Records). They have games, game accessories, blu rays dvds, regular dvds, music cds, and VHS tapes- gotta tell my Mother-in-Law since she just asked us yesterday about what she should do with all those 100s of VHS tapes. They pay $1.00 for each tape with the case in perfect condition. On the cds, it's whatever the computer says is the current market value (kinda like www.secondspin.com- except they also add the media mail rate into the total price that they pay; so strict, the cases have to be A+.). 

My husband was like, ""Why did we go in here?"" He saw several things that he wanted to buy but settled on a game for $6.99. (We had more stops to make.) I thought that the prices on the blu rays was actually pretty good- $7.99 to $19.99 (the newer ones cost more, which makes sense to me). We're always searching for new blu rays to add to our collection. Plus we have a few in mind that we want to ""replace"" (we have them in regular dvd format, but we want to upgrade to blu rays). 

I noticed that some VHS tapes were at clearance for 25 cents each. The VHS section is comprised of two small sections. I didn't really look at the regular dvds and cds.  

There were three people (two indie types & one gamer type) working there. One manning the register, one very busy with more dvd/game sorting (stacks & stacks), and one in back?; maybe on a break as there was only one other customer besides us- it wasn't busy at all.

Oddly, there is a sign in front of the (cashier) counter explaining their Buy/Sell process, however, there are a lot of rows of dvds blocking what you are supposed to read. Hmm, they should've gotten another rack or two for those dvds, as they clearly have enough space to accommodate the racks. It would be nice if there was music on- it was really quiet.

Looks like we're coming back next week. And we might sell some stuff like cds (we were gonna do it anyway, through www.secondspin.com- this would save us a trip to the post office) and video games. It's nice to know that we have more options than Zia, Target, Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Game Stop. Hope it's successful.",4
ZuX_A7zFH5BxXCd-4Z9saA,"My sister was very excited to eat at Giada's for her 30th birthday. We called ahead to make the reservation and were told she would get a dessert for her birthday. We ordered a few antipastis to start our meal and were disappointed in all of them. We then had our main course including the salmon and roasted chicken(among other meals), but unfortunately were again very disappointed with the bland and dry flavors. The end of the meal came and we were presented with dessert menus and my sisters birthday was not mentioned or celebrated. It was disappointing overall since we were all very excited but ended up spending a lot of money on overpriced, underwhelming food.",1
Fa786Db2qxoqaSSeM8n1hA,"So I've been coming here almost daily for quite awhile because I was tired of the long lines at Starbucks. Now I'm starting to feel it was a mistake. One thing Starbucks excels at is consistency. This location, on the other hand, serves a different-tasting drink each time I come. It seems to depend on who's working that day but I'm getting to the point to where my $15 a day might be more appreciated someplace else.

What irks me most is when I asked how the espresso is prepared for an iced latte I was given some ""made up"" response meant to placate the average customer. What they don't understand is that when you've been drinking the same thing for twenty years you know EXACTLY how it's supposed to taste.

Even better, the reason I'm writing this now is because they messed up the order again so I'm killing time while waiting for it to be corrected.

Note: make sure you check your food orders before leaving the drive-thru.

Update: Charged twice for soy :(",3
MC-xXXIutad73-LG6Uphrw,"I wish I had read the reviews before going to these con artists.  I took my daughter here after going to a 'regular' dentist that scared her so I thought tat she would be happier with a kids specialty dentist.

The first appointment went fine, we knew she needed two fillings so I agreed to the extra $70 for the laughing gas to make her more comfortable.  She breezed right through it and was all smiles at the end.  I was NOT smiles when they brought her out and I realized they had given her a silver cap on a visible tooth!  She looks like a hoodlum!  It's awful!  My daughter is five and thrilled she has a shiny tooth *face palm*  They didn't even ASK me.  

The second appointment was where the trouble began.  They kept her in the dentist chair for almost an HOUR before even starting on anything, I was nervous that this would make things go badly and I was right.  She started freaking out before they were done so they had to put a temporary filling in until she could come back.  That's when I paid $140 of the $170 the visit was supposed to cost and was informed the next visit would cost me $900.  

What the WHAT?!!!  It gets better!  The $900 is $400+ to monitor her after they give her the equivelant of valium to relax her, then another $70 for the laughing gas, then $360 to replace the silver gang banger tooth cap with a white one(which I was already charged over $100 for the first time).  And then the $30 for the ACTUAL WORK they would be completing.  I told them they were insane and they said they would have someone call me.  They never did, and now my kid has a temporary filling that I have to decide who I can trust to fix and not 1. scare my daughter or 2. rob me blind.",1
s-cqRysR0g7HyVx8Z5bnIw,"I'm basing my review on my recent visit to the Apple store, which, coincidentally, wasn't my first visit. 

I stopped by yesterday and as luck would have it, the store wasn't overflowing with people whose unique reason for being there is to play with iPhones and iPads they're never going to buy.  That meant that I could actually have a conversation with someone regarding the iPhone that I plan to purchase in the near future, without being pushed and shoved. Woohoo! 

I think I really lucked out because Clara (the Apple employee I spoke to) was amazing. She was super enthusiastic and took the time to answer all my questions as well as to offer suggestions and tips based on her own experience and knowledge. I did tell her upfront that I wasn't looking to buy the phone that day, but that changed absolutely nothing - I received a high level of service and despite employees NOT being on commission, I'll definitely be looking for Clara when I do go back to buy my phone. While the Apple store is usually pretty well staffed, I think that the level of service that you receive can be hit or miss. When I bought my Macbook Pro, the guy who ""took care"" of me did absolutely F-all for me other than call up my order. Considering the cost of that purchase, I'd expect amazing service but that wasn't the case. This was 3 years ago so perhaps that guy's not working there anymore!

I would suggest going shortly after the store opens to avoid the crowd. This way you can take your time and get all your questions answered without feeling rushed.",5

06CT7HFVaCV_NUPjE5J4WA,"Was very excited to go to their Tuesday night $15 buffet. Though they have gluten free, vegan, and vegetarian gravy, their toppings are pre-mixed and was not suitable for me to eat as a vegetarian. I was disappointed and thought it was questionable for a poutine place to have things pre mixed. 

Food: I got their large poutine with thick cut fries, onions, green peppers, and mushrooms. I was pretty full and ate the rest of a friend's dish (I can eat a lot). 

Service/ambiance: the servers were friendly but confusing. We were seated at the back and I could barely see what I was eating, I had to use my cell phone light to get a closer look. 

Overall: I'd come here again for their regular poutine. I'm disappointed that their ayce is not as gf/veg/vegan friendly as their gravy.",3

1P66kNKrYqsm_R8Qh3_VyQ,"Do yourself a favor and if you are going to Las Vegas and want to go to the grand canyon, call an Enterprise off of the strip and have them pick you up at the hotel and drive yourself there via GPS like I ended up doing. Everything about this company was a nightmare. Like other reviewers stated, they did heard us like cattle. We got picked up at 6:10 (had been up since 4:30 to be ready). They screwed up the hotels where they were picking other people up at and which resulted in us having to make more stops than necessary and we ended up being the last bus to the terminal to check in. Stood in line to check in for about 40 mins and finally got assigned a bus (at maybe 8-8:30am). Welllllll, that bus broke down around 10:30am and we were stuck outside the Hoover Dam for almost two hours. I literally had a nervous breakdown. It was the last day of my extremely short vacation being RUINED by this company. I ended up finding an Enterprise in Boulder City and they actually came and picked us up. The car was only $55 including mileage. Sure I paid $100 for gas roundtrip Grand Canyon National Park, but it cost me $160 for the bus anyway (for two of us) so the price was exactly the same. I called the company to say I wanted a refund and they told me I signed a waiver against mechanical failure...REALLY?! The only thing I signed was a list of names that they told me to sign next to my name to say I was checked in. They never said ANYTHING about a waiver nor did I read any material having to do with waiving liability due to mechanical issues. Complete and utter BS! 

Worst. Company. EVER!",1
5Iq4IZgYklCGvaGGidObUQ,"Food quality is so-so, unless you are Chinese and they somehow make the quality slightly better. None of the waiters were born with smiling muscles. Putting it bluntly, they are rude. This seems to be the trend with Chinese waiters. They have no manners. Customers are giving them business and supporting their salary. The least they could do is be courteous and smile. This is contrary to American waiters that are generally more cordial. Believe me, you get treated better at McDonald's. Last but not least, the rest room stinks, as is the case with most Chinese restaurants. Don't Chinese have proper hygiene?",1

The fingerling potato appetizer is also so good with crispy fried potatoes and aioli. Perfection. If you go during happy hour the burger and a couple other dishes are a few dollars cheaper.

Muddy footprints all over the floor, paper towels everywhere, and standing water just everywhere. 

The cherry on top was that I found OPEN HYPODERMIC NEEDLES in the rails of the stalls in this bathroom!! Seriously, I didn't take any pictures because I just had to get out of this bathroom!! I alerted the customer service representative, who did seem genuinely concerned, and left the store.

First, the people that do the check in are the most miserable humans in the planet. Did some one tell them to go as slow as possible? Seriously, it should take you no longer then 2-3 minutes to check me in.

The place is musty with smoke, i mean w/e i don't care that much but some people do. Their is a stale taste in the air. 

The place as a whole is kinda cool, the look of it, the indoor activities like rick wall and extreme rides like you would find on the boardwalk.

The rooms, poor without being dirty. They are boring yes. Do i feel like I'm in the 70's yes. But they are clean so i cant complain too much.

I think most culinary delights are packaged quite well in a lil tomato basil tortilla to create a compact and hand held meal, and for this reason I just love That's a Wrap.

If you're feeling über carb conscious, don't let this tortilla heaven scare you off because they will put any wrap creation's contents atop a bed of romaine or spinach.

Many of the nurses were rude to her during her stay, she struggled to get her pain meds regularly going 12hrs without any pain medication only a few days after surgery. When it came time for her to leave, the doctor wrote her a script for pain meds which she could not fill because the center filled 30days worth of her pain meds a week prior to being released so the insurance would not cover and the pharmacy showed those meds as being filled. When we contacted the care center they told her that they destroy any remaining medications and cannot release them to the patient. I have spent 5 days now trying to go between the care center, her regular doctor, and the insurance to resolve the issue. In the mean time my mother has had to suffer in pain because the care center would not contact the pharmacy or the insurance to provide them with destruction records.

We got two take out dishes -- the spicy noodle bowl and the Pad Thai. The food was super hot, in terms of temperature and took a long time to cool down.

We checked in around 9:30 and were told the restaurant closes at 10 - but they'd allow us to be seated at 10 so we rushed to our rooms, threw on a quick dress and headed back down stairs. We had a group of 6 and they were pleasant enough considering we arrived at pretty much 10 on the dot. The restaurant is stunning. The seating is laid out very nice and there are great booths and more private booth areas to choose from. All the details are beautiful. 
The food is good too. Nice wine list and cocktails to choose from. There's a prix fix menu to choose from which makes it all pretty reasonable. We had some hodgepodge assortment of items from the menu and everyone was happy with their selections.

eFnfb2_XnUotBO3xd8dArA,"I went here for a work dinner with coworkers. We picked this place because we knew it would be great for sharing plates. They have an extensive wine list, as expected, which can be a bit overwhelming. However, they have the menu on an iPad on the table so you can more easily break it down.  I had a Red Blend that I really enjoyed.  
As for the plates that we shared, there were 5 of us and we ordered 8 small plates. It was definitely more than enough! We ordered:
-Pork Belly BLT
-Pork Tacos
-Octopus
-Poke Poke
-Brussel Sprouts
-Beet Salad
-Calamari
-Goat Cheese Tortellini
+ the complimentary bread and cilantro/lime butter

Out of the above items, I would eat the pork tacos, calamari and brussel sprouts again in a heart beat. I liked the Poke as well, but wouldn't necessarily order it again. The pork BLT was delicious (cut like butter!), but hard to eat and hard to share. 
I need another excuse to go back here to try more dishes and the creme brulee, which apparently has a layer of brownie in it. Sounds amazing!
Sharing plates and splitting the bill was a good way to go. Get your money worth!",4
Jo9Oxdo6bGXHv8kZ1ttVyA,"I'm a fan of Japanese curry.  Kaba Curry is alright for the value, but it certainly isn't my favorite in town.  

I had eaten at the old location a while ago and honestly remembered liking it a little more. The curry sauce itself has an enjoyable flavor to it and they offer a nice variety of options--several of which will do in a pinch, but none that entice me to come back to them. Fans of udon noodles can get Curry Udon...that's something you don't find everywhere, but not a big enough draw for me.

Like the 3 Stars say, they're ""A-OK."" There are better options in walking distance though which make me think I will not be coming back anytime soon.

Kaba Curry is open late--2am late...so if you are in the mood for Japanese Curry and it is after 11pm when all the other shops have closed down it would behoove you stop in for a late-night bite. 

The staff is nice, but the small kitchen can get backed up in a hurry. Expect a wait if there are even a few orders ahead of you...or if you are a part of a large party.

Will definitely need to repeat to try more on the menu!",5
38c_X9WE10Zu4fcYbzI6iA,"Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews on this place before I came. If I did, I would have went elsewhere. This place is a TOTAL 2 star. I'll give it props for being brightly lit and decently clean. I ordered the coconut waffle, some frozen yogurt, an iced mocha coffee and little cream puffs that they make there. The coconut waffle was green....WEIRD. It didn't have much flavor at all. My iced coffee was HORRIBLE. I barely took 2 sips. The red velvet frozen yogurt tasted gross. It had a really weird flavor. I can't quite put my finger on it but it didn't taste like the red velvet yogurt I get a golden spoon.  The cream puffs were ok. They definitely needed more cream. One thing that really stood out, and not in a good way, was the loud speak system that announces when your order is ready. 
I've made a rule. DONT EAT AT ANYTHING LESS THAN 4 STAR. I, again, broke my own rule. I try to be spontaneous though. I try to ""live in the old days"" were Yelp doesnt rule my life. And, that fails me everytime. There are so many good places to eat in Chinatown. Unfortunately, this isn't one of them.",2

mf_L6VcOLMK69x_gC6P0Pg,"My kids really enjoy this museum. I think that there are certain ages it's catered to but we've been members since my eldest was two.

Cons:
We park at the covered parking and usually pay 2-3$for that after validation, so that may be one of the downsides.

Some interactive displays are played with so much, they are not working or work poorly and you're left feeling a little disappointed. But I get it, SO MANY KIDS play with things, they're bound to break. Maybe they could maintain more of them regularly.

Pros:
There's so much to see and do and learn. Third floor has weather displays and hands on experiments regarding weather.
2nd floor has electricity and magnetism and simple machines- very very fun for my kids age.
First floor has construction and airplane stuff
I haven't done the IMAX but hoping my kids and I can go this coming year.
Food area has good, mostly health conscious options.
Staff is always always friendly and helpful, even the volunteer staff.

We don't come that often but I'd say at least 2-3x a year keeps things interesting for my two very curious boys.",4

Returned to Utah the next day and noticed my phone was acting strange, i.e., opening up apps, typing data into msg lines, placing calls. I contacted the manager and he wanted me to remove the screen protector, which will not be usable afterwards. Then he wanted me to mail my phone to him, he would replace screen, and mail back to me but not refund me my mailing expenses. I went to a local repair shop and was informed the screen was defective. I contacted the manager at MD Wireless and asked them to pay for the new screen. He wanted me to mail the screen back to him. I explained that I would once he paid for the new screen and he would not entertain anything until I mailed the screen back to him. Avoid this place at all costs!!!",1
ioilMY0_Y-YSP2Ylh-7R9g,"This place is a hidden gem! I was looking for byob places in Laval, and came across Nazareth, specializing in middle eastern food. The decor is simple and clean - dark wood tables, banquets against the walls, and photos and artwork on the walls. Many dishes come with the salad bar - which is awesome! This is not your typical salad bar - there was fattoush,tabbouleh (refreshing but a little salty), cucumber salad, possibly the best babaganoush I've ever had, pickled turnips, olives, tomato-based slaw, and more. Everything was great. We were brought piping hot fresh pitas (house-made!) and delicious and smooth hummous. 
Our waitress was pleasant and funny, and recommended the Nazareth chicken ($11), which she said was delicious. It was! Mildly sweet and incredibly juicy. At our table was also the shish taouk plate ($9.50), kafta plate ($11), and filet mignon brochette plate ($13). Everything was very good - the kafta was flavouful and packed with crispy pieces of onion and fresh parsley, and the filet was nicely cooked, though there was a little grizzle. There was a bit of confusion with the orders in terms of ordering half rice/potatoes and only receiving potatoes, but the rice was good so I didn't mind. The value/quantity/quality ratio is pretty hard to beat - I wish I knew about his place earlier!",4

What I DON'T like it watered down yogurt! *cough cough* (Mojo on Mill Ave) 
This place is really good and the yogurt isn't watered down. I used to live out this way so I would come here often especially since it was open til midnight on weekends!

I love the variety of topping they have, cheesecake!!!!!! That is a topping I usually don't see at Yogurt shops.

The staff was very friendly and answered all of my first timer questions. Ok now to the food. I ordered a cheese burger not knowing that the regular comes with 2 patties and the cajun fries. Let's start with the best fresh cut fries that I have ever tasted at a fast food establishment. They were freshly cut, seasoned to perfection, and about the size of human fingers. They serve them in a cup but don't stop there, then they throw the cup in a brown paper bag and toss another handfull of fries on top of that. AMAZING. Well worth the 3 dollars, and one order will definitely feed 2 full size adults. I ordered the hamburger with just about everything on it because I wanted to experience the gooey,sloopiness, of other burgers that cost about the same. I almost had trouble finishing the meal because it was that over the top. All of the toppings were free so they don't try to nickle and dime you. I paid 19 bucks for 2 burgers, one order of regular fries and 2 drinks. Give it a shot you want be disappointed.",4
85DXIv3HW-bNqOWkqD5aAQ,"I was on a business trip and just happened to book a hotel near the Airport - not knowing that the neighborhood was a Punjabi belt. I was in Mississauga for around 4 days and I must say that for the first time in my 20 years of being outside of India, I actually had Indian food - in all my meals. 
I ended up dividing my visits between Punjabi Dhaba and Standard Sweets.

About Standard Sweets - It is right next to the airport and is primarily a sweet shop, selling Indian sweet and salty snacks. They have a kitchen in the back and a restaurant area in half of the shop. They serve Indian buffet for lunch and also have ""a la carte"" menu through out the day.
The place is just ok when it comes to neatness/tidiness. 

The food is delicious and is true Punjabi style. Their paranthas are great and very filling.

The rates are very nominal and they also have a free Wi-Fi in house.

There are 2 issues i have with their food and set up:
1) The food is very oily and greasy. I reminded them every time to not make my food greasy - and sure enough - that never happened. It was always dripping with oil/butter/ghee etc.
2) The kitchen is run my some old Indian aunties - and to that extent, the hygiene part is sort of iffy. Use of hands, without gloves, open sneezing etc is common. In fact, one early morning, I ended up being at the shop right when it just opened and saw one of the old aunties eating in a bowl, washing it in the restroom and keeping it back in the stack to be used for buffet. Obviously, I never went back to them ever again.

Punjabi Dhaba, right next door turned out great for me and I spend rest of my dollars and days there.

Am giving them 3 stars because of the 2 issues I mentioned above.",3

The restaurant which is around Queen and Carlaw, is in a bit of an oddly shaped space with a lovely entry, followed by a narrow section then opening into large inviting almost communal room with high ceilings, one exposed brick wall and a white semi exposed kitchen in the back.
The food was very good. I had seared scallops for an app and chicken for a main. The chicken was very good and done almost like a cordon bleu in the shape of a log. I rarely would order chicken at a restaurant but this was worth it. The dishes were both prepared with tasty well thought out sides. 
Along with a fun cocktail list this place is worth the ride to the more and more trendy queen East.",4

xIMVZ-Y7_7MWs7fA49nsDA,"I was genuinely disappointed by this place. After my 3rd visit, I haven't been back and am currently switching to a new OBGYN.

 Dr. Webeh has too many patients and has a lack of compassion for a first time mother such as myself. When I first came in, I told him I thought I was pregnant. He pretty much took my word for it, and never even gave me a pregnancy test himself! Just sent me off to the lab.

They don't follow up with lab results. I called Dr. Webeh and asked him about it after almost two weeks. He asked ""Did anyone call you?"". I said ""No, but I would like reassurance that everything is okay"". He responds ""Well that probably means its okay. How bout you call me on Monday afternoon, and i'll see what I can do"". 

The last straw was when he gave me a pap. (I'm going to try and use as few details as possible). I'm 25 years old, so I've had my share of them. After not prepping the tools properly, he gave me the MOST PAINFUL pap I've ever had in my life. While I was whimpering on the table, he continued probing me until he realized he would have to stop and give me a moment because it was too painful. Finally it was done, and after he was finished he stood right up and asked me if I had any questions, WHILE MY LEGS WERE STILL IN THE STIRRUPS. Didn't give me a chance to get myself together or relax. I said no. He read me my previous lab results and walked right out. 

I will NEVER recommend this place.",1

Atmosphere: Restaurant is tucked away on a street. We almost passed it! When you walk in, it's extremely dark and really loud. BUT we were siting next to a table of 10. Our waitress was kind, but was far and between when checking on us. 

Food: A great range of tapas food. From vegetarian, sea and meat. It's hard to pin point what stood out because we ordered at least 15 different plates. But personally the Prosciutto Crostini sticks out. ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. It was a bold punch of flavors. That just melts in your mouth. I would go back JUST to eat this. We stuck with a bottle of wine and skipped deserts.

Overall: Would I return? Maybe at lunch if it was better lit? And was able to have a conversation with my colleagues. Also for the crostini. Wasn't blown away.",3

tZtbLzLu9Vc7Hsqc2R2oHA,"I effin LOVE hot dogs so when I found out that this place was opening down the street I was delighted, and went opening day.

I order the basic naked dog since I find it's just to judge a place on how the they cook something simple.

So what does a $6.50 hot dog taste like?

Not much different than one for $3 that you can get on a street corner.

The sausage was average, nothing special. The bun was a dissapointment and wouldn't surprise me if they get it from the same place your corner hot dog vendor does... it was also burnt a little. I understand that during a rush this is something that might happen to a piece of bread left over fire but the place was empty. Common guys.

The toppings were creative but unnecessarry, rhubarb this, blueberry mayo that, somekind of crab flavoured sauce. Why would I want to put ""fresh"" soaking wet mozzarella on my hotdog? The relish was good.

They didnt appear to have yellow mustard, which I am assuming isn't goumet enough, BUT they had ketchup.

While I was eating, 2 of the workers were discussing what appeared to be a sausage at the end of a long fork that one of them was holding. After some deliberation he threw it into the garbage. That's 6 bucks doooood, I could have taken the bus twice with that sausage. That sausage couldve helped me pay my phone bill last month.

I wanted to try the maple lemonade I read about but it was $5. That's five dollars for lemons and water people.

Save your time go to WVRST for a larger, cheaper, more interesting hot dog/sausage selection.",2
Gij1xXlQPn6IE2G_K0oeCA,"In a word, disappointing.  I've never dined at Delux.  Despite their reputation, I find it hard to believe that I could get a burger, better then an animal style, Double-Double, outside my own grill.  Now that I know that the folk who own Delux also own Revo, I doubt that I will ever taste a Delux burger.

My friend and I ordered separately.  I, a Green Chili burrito and she, a cheese crisp.  Service was OK.  I got my burrito in a timely fashion but my friend had to wait forever for her cheese crisp.  This isn't a sit down joint so I don't discredit it too much for that.

I picked up my burrito and as it was flopping over, I took my first bite.  It deflated.  I saw what little was inside, sink to the bottom half of the tortilla.  My burrito was half-hollow.  What filling was inside was bland and of little substance.  The salsa was pretty good but needing it is not a plus.

My friends cheese crisp was good but no points for melting cheese on an open tortilla and slapping guacamole and pico de gallo on it.

I certainly won't be eating here again.  I am not fooled by upscale decor.

On a side note: The Jalisco-style places are just as fresh as a Revo.  Saying they're not makes you look ignorant and stuck-up.",2

I started with her a couple years ago after seeing a lifelong friend after not seeing her for several months. I was blown away by how good she looked. She literally looked between 10 and 15 years younger. All the gravity of aging in her face was gone and she just looked amazing. I was seeing a woman out here in Marin for my facial needs. I immediately flew to Vegas to see what Martine could do for my face. I am beyond happy with the results. The thing about her is that she looks at your face (my face), takes your natural contours and planes and gives them just the right touch to enhance your natural beauty and take the aging off. Plus, I have the most beautiful lips and cheekbones now that God forgot to give me. No one would guess my real age and I would like to keep it that way.

ylnwJcJQ3LuRrURcKcPcEw,"Walked in to try their Juicy Lucy Burger which is combo 1.  It's a 5oz patty with cheese inside the patty.

The burger was priced at $5.99..

Would have preferred a 8oz size burger, I'm a beef guy and 4oz to 5oz just doesn't do it for me. Asked about a making it a double Juicy Lucy but he said because the cheese is already built in, it doesn't taste good.

Overall the patty tasted ok.. But it was just too small, tasted home-made, fresh, 100% beef. So $5.99 for a cheese burger is not bad for value.  However, I think they should definitely put a bigger size patty option for their signature burger.. Also considering this place is called Big Moe's Burger.. You expect big..

The chef did heat up the bun and it was slightly toasted, but the bun was cold, thick, over-powered the beef, so it ruined the burger for me for.

Would come back and try a different burger, maybe the double cheese burger with additional beef strips.. Hopefully I can bump up the rating to a 3 star joint..",2
oLancHOLe2KupNDBu84SHg,"Great cheap eats in comparison to other restaurants!  The burger costs $6.00 and the ribeye $14.99.  For some reason there is no mention in other reviews of the ""honest to goodness fee"" of 3%.. I asked the server and  this is to keep the price low. Not bad. That's only $3.00 per $100.00 spent.

This was the old all stars wings and the place is great with tables, booths, lots of space, big dining area and big screen TVs.

I asked the server if they play pay per view like ufc or boxing. They said yes. They had the m Gregor vs khabib fight. Yes, this is a great secret I could have kept to ensure it doesn't get too busy here, but am sharing with you all.

Considering the price of the food and the fact they have a beautiful venue and live events, this place is a fantastic place! Servers were friendly. Not only that beer is cheap!! $4 pints when the leafs play and $5 30oz pints,  it sure if this is only for Tuesday.

Now, they also have chicken wings for half price after 9 pm. I can imagine this place gets packed!!!

Will definitely come back!!!!",5

Went in, and after spending 10 minutes waiting to be helped, finally spoke with an employee who could barely be bothered to write down the exact specs and model I was looking for a quote on. Told me he was too busy to help me further at the time, but he promised to follow up in the forthcoming days. Of course, nothing. I called back a week later to try and follow up, and left all the same info as before, but never heard again. Bizarre business model. Apparently they lack interest in both customers and making money.

The good - the decor is awesome.  Decent prices to bowl.  Awesome location. 

The bad - the bartenders just make it nearly impossible to drink here.  I guess they don't want to make much money for the Lanes or for themselves... I've been here before where I just wanted to stop by to see some friends who were bowling, and i couldn't get served because I wasn't bowling. Which is just unreal.  There were maybe 3 or 4 people inside the bar too and still couldn't get a drink. Recently, i was here with a group of people... I almost didn't get served again because I couldn't prove I was bowling, although I was waiting for my party to arrive!  I also understand needing to card someone, but as a 36 year old guy, if a friend wants to go to the bar and grab a beer for himself and me, I shouldn't have to walk all the way back to the bar every single time.  It's just so inconvenient...",2

As with most Ethiopian restaurants, the menu items are served on a generous disk of soft injera bread, with more injera bread served on the side. While I was tempted to get the Veggie Combo with its 7 items and salad, I'm glad I opted to get the 4-item veggie combo because even that turned out to be a lot of food. I chose misir wat (red split lentils), fosolian (spiced string beans with carrots and onion), tikil gomen (cabbage with potatoes), and mushroom wat. The combo was a good balance of mild and bold-spicy flavors, and refreshing iced yekemen shai (a herbal tea of cloves, cinnamon, and cardamom) was a perfect match for the flavorful viands. This restaurant is a gem of a find in the Arcadia area.",4

uqHGQmTBDT-A-zWC7Aa8Aw,"I am a customer for life thanks to Stephanie! For my birthday my husband got me a gift card to get a facial before my son's wedding. I booked the appointment 3 months in advance along with a haircut. A week before my appointment I was told the gal who was going to do the facial would be a way at a conference. The only other day I had available was the following Monday but she wouldn't come in to accommodate me. So when I asked for my money back on the gift card I was told Stephanie would call me back. Within a couple of hours not only did Stephanie call me back but she had gotten another gal to come in to do my facial on the Monday I wanted, rescheduled my hair appointment and threw in a deep conditioning treatment for the trouble.  I have always been very happy with this salon and was really bummed about the facial. Stephanie made it for it and then some. TRULY AMAZING customer service and ended up making me feel very special. Thank you Stephanie! You are true class act.  And Terri who had to call me to tell all of this was so patient and gracious and tried so very hard to help accommodate me. Her customer service too was outstanding! Thank you!",5

The people dining here were extremely loud, and this wasn't limited to a single group of people.  There used to be a cozy and warm vibe here, but that's been completely voided by the obnoxious behavior of the patrons.

jjaSLV7FSK-T2uS06Laztg,"Hmmm where to start with the whitewater center. My friends and I all have season passes so there's very little we haven't done. It's great for families, groups of friends, team building events, etc. I'm just gonna start from the beginning. You walk up to the front and you're greeted by one of the friendliest guys I've ever met. He's always asking how you're doing, what you're planning, always followed by the most sincere ""I hope you guys really enjoy your time here today"" (or something along those lines). Everybody who works there has the same personality- always looking for ways to make your day better. We usually start off with the zip line. It's just a good way to wake up. Plus you feel kinda like you're flying. My favorite part is the rafting, of course. Raft guides can accommodate all groups, from families with young children to wild, crazy 20 and 30-somethings. You just tell them what kind of ride you want and they'll give it to you. If you want a safe ride, they can do that. If you want to be guaranteed to fall out, they can do that too. Request ""rafting roulette"" for a great time! well, as long as you don't have kids with you. You're pretty much guaranteed a rough ride and someone will probably fall out but it is SOOOO much fun you cant help but laugh when it's over. All of the ropes courses are fun and a good challenge. The flatwater kayaking and paddleboarding are both great ways to explore the Catawba river. If you want to, you can park you kayak or paddleboard and just lay out on one of the beaches, or just float along the river. It's very relaxing! And the best part? The end of the day. There's a great selection of beer (including beers from local breweries) at The Rivers Edge Bar and Grill and after a long day of playing in the water and burning tons of calories, a cool refreshing beer is perfect. Can't wait for next season and all the new things to come!",5

We looked into it to see what the issue was, and it turns out the flushing mechanism was held together by a rusty safety pin. We called the front desk to have it fixed, but it took 2 hours. The biggest issue we had is that our card was charged incorrectly. We paid for a package deal for a hotel room and tickets to an event, in addition to a single day since we arrived a day early. The front desk assured me that the deposit would just cover the one day since the rest of the weekend was covered by the package deal. A week later, my card was charged for the full weekend instead of the one day. I called in the morning to get the charge reversed, but the front desk said they needed a manager to reverse the charge. I called the manager Heather herself and left a message, and I have not heard at all from her. I finally called the front desk again and someone named Fiji said she would reverse the charges, however I still not have received the reversal and they did not offer a receipt.

Our server seemed pretty knowledgeable and seemed to have everything memorized thoroughly. She came with sample of meat which was pretty neat I think to see the cuts and quality of what you're about to order . (Posting a video) 

Soon as we sat down, they served us a platter full of wide selection of breads with the butter with Black British Sea Salt . It was so delicious . We asked for the most popular dishes there and she suggested the rib cap - which has been my favourite steak I've ever eaten so far ! Just melts in your mouth and the glaze is absolutely delicious . My husband ordered Beef Wellington (Ramsays signature dish) which I've tried as well and I liked my rib cap better . Wellington had tons of flavours and in layers . It was like a party in your mouth . Although one item that sticks to my tastebuds still and I can't get over it has to be the truffle Mac n cheese made with blue cheese . God bless them for coming up with that dish !  Make sure to order that . We've also ordered loaded baked potatoes which was very well seasoned and delicious as well. 

However , a plain glass of water will cost you US $10. But like I said , one of those nights you just want to splurge ! This has been an awesome memory for both me and my husband and I would definitely go back here .",5

It's such a simple thing, but the bread and butter that came with the pasta was really good. Scallops and fish have been excellent here, but I'm not a huge fan of some of the pasta. The squid ink pasta is in a spicy red tomato sauce which is too much for me. Other than that, North is a great choice, whether you're here for drinks and appetizers or for a full dinner.

The Studio - the upkeep of the studio has deteriorated since I was there 2 years ago. The ladies's room smells like BO, but I suppose that is expected given that it's a hot yoga studio.

Reminds me of Florida where I lived for 14 years and going back to next week for good. The décor the set-up of the restaurant reminds me of Florida. Most of all the food reminds me of Florida. I had 2 servings of the raw oysters, the brisket/rib combination with corn and baked beans and it was soooo good! The brisket literally melts in your mouth when you bite into it. I had the jalapeno (level 2) sauce and it gave it that extra kick which really set off the flavor of the meat. My GF had the salmon with rice and hush puppies. The salmon was pretty close to perfect with white rice and came with coleslaw. All was really good. Our server was Lexie (?) who was very knowledgeable and accommodating and believed in the product she was selling. For being on the job for a week she was very professional and knew her job.

Mine was delicious, and like some others mentioned here... NO GREASE hangover! I tried some of the philly and it was amazing, and that jalapeno sauce was truly great! I could eat it alone.... the pork frybread, however was a little bit too salty and was the worst dish we ordered. That being said, it was still delicious.

R-Q5dELRmLbr7j1ydG8fow,"Dewey, AZ.  Took samples of our grey driveway rock and our natural soil to help pick a color that was complementary for our landscaping.  The contact on our prior phone call was extremely helpful in giving advice and calculating quantity which would be a 5 star for us.  Free delivery on 10 tons and the expertise of the delivery driver were also worth a 5 star rating.  Where the service was a total fail was in the rock that was delivered to us.  We ordered the cinnamon based on the sample color at the site and were willing to pay a premium price since it matched out color needs so well.  What we received was rock that was mostly dingy grey that is not much different from our cheaper driveway gravel.  It looks like we tried to match that driveway stuff and just made a mistake.

MSSc2GuinzsEDTBOVZzxmw,"I was at Madison Night Market last night pigging out at various food trucks. I came across El Wiscorican and a Costa Rican food truck with very similar offerings next to it. I had a hard time choosing between them, so I flipped a coin. I gotta say, I am so glad it landed on tails.

El Wiscorican was serving a combo plate of the day and a sandwich call La Tripleta. I got both:

The plate of the day was pork with Puerto Rican-style rice and a choice of a side (I picked savory fried bananas AKA tostones). For $9, I got a big clamshell filled generously with rice, pork, and tostones. The rice was deliciously savory and salty and also had some green olives and what appeared to be lentils. The pork was meaty and chunky with the perfect amount of fat. The spicy, creamy sauce on top gave the dish the moisture it needed. My only complaints were that the pork was barely too salty and that the tostones were too thin, dry, and sweet. I'm not going to lie, I was really looking forward to good tostones, so I was pretty disappointed.

La Tripleta is absolute perfection. Let's start with the foundation of any good sandwich, the bread. They claim to bake the bread fresh every day, and I believe it! It was perfectly soft and sweet. It was like Hawaiian bread and amaroso rolls had a baby on steroids. The meat mixture of beef, pork, and chicken with mayo ketchup had a great meaty and saucy texture. The crunchy potato sticks provide a nice textural contrast. If you're a fan of philly cheese steaks, you can't afford to pass up La Tripleta.

It's a shame that El Wisorican is mostly a lunch truck that I won't have access to. I'll have to keep my eyes peeled for when it's out for dinner time.",4

Not only did no one even acknowledge me when I came in, I was waiting and was completely disregarded to help another customer who came in 10 minutes after me. Then not only one, but 2 associates went to help her, and I had to ask to be helped as I had been standing there clearly waiting for service. When I was finally helped I said I had JUMP and wanted to upgrade from an iPhone 5s to 7plus. The kid helping me doesn't ask me anything, brings a sheet over telling me I owe $160 today and $35 a month, not for how long or for what reason. I had to then ask why it was so much, and he proceeds to tell me that the price included A protector and case that I didn't ask for, nor was I asked if I wanted. Then I asked to remove those items and the price only dropped $10 for the down payment today and $4 a month. Then he broke down the charges for me and said $20 upgrade fee which is supposed to covered through JUMP. He then says ""that's only if you trade your phone in"" well he at no point asked if that was something I wanted to do, and I also heard the associate next to him tell the guy she was helping all that JUMP does is waive the upgrade fee. So, clearly there's a whole lot of misunderstanding and poor training at this location. By the guys obvious frustration next to me and his comments and questions he was asking, I'm not the only one who feels totally misguided by T-Mobile.",1
0UG7dKoDilaXwiuCQr2tLg,"We were disappointed by this place. The pastries, (which we walked a decent distance just to try, hearing that they were some of the best in Mtl) were dry and hard. Myself and my fiancé tried the blueberry Danish, a regular croissant, chocolate croissant and an almond chocolate croissant and all were dry except for the Danish, which was the clear winner of the group. The filling was delicious and the pastry wasn't dried out and hard like the others. The coffee was pretty good, not the best, and the tables in the sitting area upstairs were a little messy, but to be fair they looked extremely busy! I probably wouldn't return, we had better pastries in other non-bakeries in Montreal!",3
scJTQPs91e0lrI6eL3ovmg,"Great service, great price! No hidden or added fees, priced less than a lot of companies that I looked at, and amazing service. The guys arrived on time, and worked more than efficiently. they took great care of my belongings and were very professional. I definitely recommend this company.",5
gv46TNYfudUEx9x-JGzpNg,"One of my favorite dishes as a meat eater was Shepherds pie,  so since I no longer eat meat I decided to try it vegan style.  All I can say is that it was warm, satisfying and delicious.  I was pleasantly surprised at the depth of flavor.  As far as the cost at Pomegranate's it is pricey but on the other hand you can feed two people with most dishes they serve there.  That includes their wonderful bakery items.  I have eaten there on 3 occasions and each time I have been more than happy with the food.  My only complaint is that it does seem to take a while to get your food which is okay due to the quality, but if you ask for something else, extra during your meal it seems like you may never get it.  Then suddenly when you have about given up here it comes.  The staff there could not be nicer but they seem somewhat spread thin.  Oh and I want to mention almost everything in their desert case is gluten free and the gluten free bread there is delish.",4
XiQrkbh9l5U528psZOOJIA,"""I'll eat anything if you are nice to me""....""and my favorite restaurant's are the one that are nicest to me""... So this place has a great culture and outstanding food!!!
I am lucky enough to have been a number of times to Rao's New York, and what people don't realize is that what makes it great is not just the food, but the warmth with which you are treated from Frank Sr. and his crew. You feel like you are family in his home. And he is quite a singer, and treats his customers to that as well. 
Well, I am not sure if Frank Jr. can sing, but he emits the same warmth as his dad. What a class act! And the staff was great. ""Buffalo Mike"" served me at the bar, and couldn't have been better. And the food was just as good as in NY. 
They were filming for the food network while I was there, part of  ""10 Best places to eat before you die"". Watch it! 
So what are you waiting for? You will feel right at home.",5
QNWO1Jcjtwku6N6N47kSwg,"After months of anticipation for their Toronto opening, I was super excited to try Jelly Modern Doughnuts. The Jelly Modern website says that they ""reinvent the doughnut with sophisticated flavours and high quality ingredients to create a uniquely crafted artisan treat"" - sounds amazing, right? Soft opening was today, and Kiddo and I were there first thing! The shop is really cute, design-y with lots of modern white, hot pink accents, and a pink ""velvet rope"" to manage those inevitable lineups. 

We purchased 4 regular doughnuts @ $2.75 each, and 2 ""Three Bite"" mini-doughnuts @ $2.25 each. (Jelly doesn't charge tax on orders of 6 or more.) Flavours purchased were: Madagascar Vanilla, Coconut, Smores, Cinnamon-Sugar, Maple Bacon, and Lemon Curd. Cinnamon-Sugar is a cake doughnut, the others are all raised yeast doughnuts. Cinnamon-Sugar is coated in cinnamon and sugar of course, and Coconut has coconut on the outside, but all of the other doughnuts sported a thick glaze or chocolate coating. 

After sampling all these flavours, I have to say, I found these doughnuts to be.... not that exciting. Not exactly ""meh"", but I'm not crazy about them. I personally find them to be a bit too doughy and very over-glazed. I prefer light, dry glazing; and this is more of a thick, wet glaze. I don't want my glaze to be like icing or frosting, I actually want glaze. Doughnut people - it's like a Krispy Kreme glaze - heavy and very sweet. I'm not a fan of Krispy Kreme's, and I can take or leave these. As for the cake cinnamon-sugar doughnut, it seemed almost overdone, too crispy on the outside, and lacking anything special about the crumb on the inside. On the plus side, it was coated with just the right amount of cinnamon-sugar.

My favorite flavour by far was the coconut, with coconut cream and coconut on top. It was truly delicious. I will be going back for more coconut!!

The biggest disappointment was the lemon curd. I love a lemon curd doughnut, but this lemon curd was just blah, utterly forgettable. With the addition of the doughy doughnut and very thick glaze, the overall effect was way too sweet and cloying, not the little bite of sunshine that lemon should be! Also was hoping for more from the maple bacon - the maple glaze is very heavy and very sweet; the balance with the bacony salty goodness just wasn't there. (Dough Toronto @ Beast's maple bacon is a far superior doughnut in every way.) 

I love doughnuts, and I think that's one of the reasons I'm not so crazy about these - they actually remind me of cupcakes, with the too sweet and the overglazed quality, they seem to have more in common with the cupcake than the doughnut. High quality ingredients? Sure. Sophisticated? Not so much. Artisan? Not really. But if you like your doughnuts to be more like cupcakes, you will probably love Jelly Modern. Either way, it's a nice addition to the Toronto doughnut scene, go visit and try them for yourself! Or check my doughnut list for other places to get your TO doughnut fix. :)",3
A8usqRvkIjtg5J4_nbiJxw,"Just like my hamburger theory...if you need too many add ons the meat must be lousy. 
Actually the dogs are ok, the chili sauce is essentially a gut grease slide so skip it unless you like that kind of gastro torture. 
The texas toast approach is novel and works...if your dog is not over slathered with mustard etc. 
The more is better theory is so crazily applied here that when asking for just mustard (like a normal person) and relish I was assaulted with lettuce, MAYO!!, two mustards and relish on the side. 
This is one place that could really benefit from robot ordering.",2
bKeFcXk6oJsIdhzsFVhlbA,Food was great. I had the BLT and fries. Exellent fries and very large portions. One of the best BLT's I have had. The bacon was crispy and delcious. They also have daily cupcake varieties made by a local baker.  I have reccomended it to several people already.,5

I will not be coming back because there are better choices than here.",3
em327JtxAehYzCjrqI6k-A,Only complaint was the wait but it was worth the 20 min. Got he turkey burger and the original ringer. Amazing! Huge portions but we had a small breakfast and ended up not eating dinner. Sharing might be a good option if you're not too hungry or want dinner later! Fries have a tasty seasoning on them. Pleasantly surprised at how amazing everything was.,5
pYifTQ4gAqcDuETgXwHG3g,"I enjoy healthy smoothies where I can literally taste the leaves that were blended inside. Somehow, it makes me feel healthier, and a little better about myself. The smoothies here are very FRESH (as you probably get from the name) and taste very healthy. They come in a pretty large size and they also give you a little cup of extras! The salads that they offer are pretty good, though they are prepackaged. I had fun jiggling around the congealed dressing of my Tuscany salad. I wouldn't say I was FULL full when I finished my meals (maybe I'm just a fatty) but I was satisfied.",4
DIC1xvVyFEhCGlODyBPEBQ,Joel Robuchon rocks. The food is a work of art and taste amazing. The decor and service is awesome. It is a min of 2.5 hrs that you will be sitting there but it is worth it. The 16 course meal will take 3 plus hrs (my father walked out in the middle of it because it was too long). I would recommend the 7 courses over the 16 (my father didn't finish the 7 either). If you want to impress a date then this is the place.,4
ygpUFSddbGKsrdNtSW7UQg,This place is clean and serves good food. I have come on multiple occasions with my boyfriend and each time we have loved it. The first time I got their grilled beef sandwich and then the second time I go the pho. I have a place I used to go but its so far now but finding this place has been awesome. Their broth is fragrant and everything tastes fresh. I also ordered their mango smoothie and it was one of the best smoothies I have ever had. It was creamy and tasted just like eating a mango. Always coming here when I get a pho craving,5
S9T2ob_-6SVjAQp0eR1jwg,"Visited this place because we received a $100.00 voucher for sitting through a two hour time share presentation. Winning! Right? Not exactly. 

The wife and I had been to a Churrascaria the weekend before in San Antonio, and we're blown away. We hoped that for the fact it's in Vegas, Pampas to be much better. 

We arrived on time for a 730 reservation, and we're told to wait another 15 minutes. No problem, sat at the bar for a while. We were finally seated 30 minutes later, and waited 10 minutes for our server. Finally the floor manager took our drink order. 

The salad bar was not as good as places I've been in the past. The only item I liked were the deep fried bananas and cheese bread. Some items I usually enjoy, mashed potatoes, tempura, and Caesar salad all fell short. 

The meat came around infrequently. Initially only 4 cuts came around on a regular basis, without seeing any other meats. We eventually told those guys to stop coming, and told the manager. Slowly other cuts came around, and we became frustrated. I don't think either of us got out fill. 

The quality of the meat was poor. Nothing stood out except for bacon wrapped turkey, but then again how can you mess up bacon. 

We spoke with the manager again, and he comped us desert. I had the cheesecake which was ""okay"". 

I would not come here again unless I has another voucher, and if I did I would drink a lot of beer and fill up on fried bananas.",1

The service was slow, not her fault, but having more staff on the floor would have helped.  Our drinks finally show up and they are horrible.  Horrible!  Our appetizers come and we had to send two back.  One tasted like smoke and other smelled spoiled, was soggy and greasy.  We finally got to speak with a manager and nothing was done about it and he didn't  seem that apologetic.  We will not be returning.",1

Having recently returned to Alize for a meal that was good, but again marred by service errors and a clientele that often lacks the class befitting such cuisine, it was with high hopes that I sat down to dinner in Andre Rochat's eponymous Monte Carlo dining room where a more serene space saw Chef Christopher Bulen send forth a feast worth feting, all four courses as refined as the environs with several classics still capable of eliciting wows.

Bearing Andre's name, but assuredly Bulen's kitchen as the young Chef reinvigorates the menu seasonally with new concepts joining Rochat's classic French plates, it was with pleasant smiles that myself and a friend were greeted at the hostess stand and led through the bar to a table dressed in linen an a la carte experience was almost entirely self-selected, the welcoming glasses of bubbly soon followed by an amuse of Veal Broth perfumed in Black Truffles plus fresh baked Bread with Butter, my companion easily encouraged to indulge in the signature ""Marti Foie"" that was every bit as lovely as I'd remembered.

Far less ridiculously priced than the imported French giants at Caesars' or MGM, several items from the $10 ""Small Plates"" section actually a bargain when taking into account both quality and amount, those looking for something vegetarian are highly encouraged to consider peppery Caponata while omnivores may wish to experience garlic laced frog legs that slip straight from bone to palate, Christopher's passion for housemade meats showing in supple white sausage or creamy pork spread, the former served along with ethereal puff pastry and one of three sausages made in house daily.

Again offering a complimentary education in wine pairings, the prior visit actually leaving me a bit overwhelmed given a low tolerance, slow sips were taken of small pours including an outstanding 2011 Sauternes that arrived to announce two highly anticipated plates, the Classic French Onion Soup more classic and meaty than Mark Purdy's at Alize but a bit lost in the mix when set next to seared Foie Gras plus a Terrine, the latter 'au naturale' with jam and toast for spreading while the warm steak saw the caramelized exterior give way to silken luxury, the combination of Rhubarb Streusel, melted Marshmallow and Balsamic faintly reminiscent of Peanut Butter and Jelly.

Taking one classic, one favorite and a generous $9 side of Sweet Potato Spaetzle for the final round of savories it was admittedly a bit disappointing that the Dover Sole was presented under a silver dome rather than being fileted table-side, but with that quibble noted it certainly did not detract from the moist flesh and light sauce Amandine, the rosy Duck undoubtedly a more hearty plate with dark rice sopping up all the pan jus as encased liver and force meat used delicate spicing to impart levity in a truly rich sausage.

Personally well sated as my dining partner questioned just how many bites he had left it was at the Chef's suggestion that three 'new-to-me' cheeses were presented along with 20 Year Tawny Port, the Beltane offering creamy complexity well matched to the accoutrements while Camembert washed in  Calvados was quite pungent unless appreciated bite for bite with pickled fruit or fig jam.

Offering desserts from Tammy Alana, easily one of the most under-appreciated names working in pastry nationwide, there was little doubt after the Cadbury masterpiece of Easter 2014 that a Souffle had to be ordered, the cloudy 'carrot cake' cleverly complimented with cream cheese Anglaise while four more sweets also joined the party, a poached pear not exactly my favorite when paired to chocolate while the Cheesecake bathed in fruit syrup ate several times lighter than any ""New York"" version, the Bourbon tinged Fondant expectedly rich as a trio of Raspberry Profitteroles crackled to the tooth atop Meyer Lemon Cream.",5
mrqj7bqfkZA6SvnbYUmiRQ,"This is the first food truck I experienced in Phoenix. The actual restaurant on Roosevelt has an expanded menu. I would recommend their hotdog wrapped in bread. The sides are all good--fries or cold slaw---and everything is served in this amazing metal tins with compartments. I also like the hotdog with sauerkraut and thousand island dressing. On the donuts side, come early or the best, fresh made choices might be gone like the coconut spicy Thai one.

The two of us were able to share the entree and still had about half left to take home as leftovers. The food was prepared quickly and was extremely fresh for a fast food type of restaurant.

When it came time for deposit returned, we hired cleaners and left the place cleaner than it was when we moved in, but a single speck of dog hair trapped in a corner was used to claim it wasn't clean enough. ALSO they claimed their guy said he had to remove a smoke smell when -no one- smoked in that house, EVER. So they took most of our deposit and left us with a measly $150.

You can see their posts here are a sort of damage control, but none of them apologize for any confusion or what may have happen and are entirely defensive.  Expect the same when you get screwed.",1
or19AXQC0yI8Y01LdF162w,"You know that feeling when you go to a restaurant and you don't want to give it a bad review? Well, today is one of those days. The food was sub par. We had ordered the guacamole which was pretty good. My fiancé ordered the carne asada tacos which were better than the al pastor tacos I ordered. Mine were bland and dry. 

Our waitress however was on another planet. She was one of those waitresses who tried to impress you by taking your order but not writing it down. I have to admit, I do get impressed when waitresses do that, but I'm not impressed when they swing by 15 minutes after taking our order to make sure she remembered it correctly (this was done throughout the night). I also got annoyed how they would offer to bring chips but never did and we also waited forever for our food that should have only taken 10 to 15 minutes to make. FYI: the restaurant wasn't even busy, 8 people were there max on a Monday night at 7:15pm. 

Being a foodie, I really dislike writing bad reviews but if I hadn't had such crappy service, or didn't have to wait forever for food that I had ordered, I think I would have had a better experience.",2
3z6FtT833Bd0GboBnrsofw,"Great experience, average food. As mentioned the place can be loud but this is because of the other people around you and not the restaurant itself.

Despite this I enjoyed myself it was a fun experienced eating a meal in that manner. The food was OK without being amazing. Nothing was cold and the service was great. This is a place that I would definitely recommend that you try once, but beyond being a novelty dinner for friends who have never been there, I cannot see myself dining there again.",4

Food was ok, just didn't believe it should be so expensive.  It was also very smokey inside due to the kitchen being in the middle of the room.",2
vFhfwfGlimry0amFE15Q3g,"Haven't updated in a while... And I have a few issues with the mean reviews I've recently read here. Because they couldn't be further from the truth.. Let me explain...no busy restaurant is ever perfect..But many of these 'complaints' I feel are shady and here's why....

A. If these people were so so sooooo unhappy with their order.... WHY didn't they just tell their server and order something else? Boom! Easy fix. 

B. If people felt like they were being ignored.. WHY didn't they just say, ""YO!! Rememeber me.. Get me a seat!""  -I know people 'feel' they shouldn't have to do this.. But give me a break and get thicker skin. This is a BUSY BAR/RESTAURANT!!!!  
If I everrrrr feel like a place forgot to seat me, I remind them very quickly.. Then I get seated and definitely don't hold some weird grudge to later trash them on Yelp. (I have these exact examples in my reviews to prove this.) 

C. Don't trash a restaurants' reviews based on their prices.  You see the prices before ordering. It's not fair in my opinion. A restaurant's set prices, that you see before ordering.. Aren't a reason to trash them on Yelp. 



Anyways.. I felt it necessary to say all this because, this restaurant has consistently been great. At all times... And if I ever ordered something I didn't like, it was a quick fix. The staff has always been so very nice... Have I ever had to wait longer than usual on a very busy night? Who hasn't.. But it's impossible to please every single patron at all times... I just enjoy the atmosphere and good conversation with whoever is next to me, Until the very attentive staff has time to get back to me. 

This is a small restaurant. Nothing corporate about it, and I love that, so should every reviewer. They shouldn't knock the place for what makes it so unique and awesome.  Great ambiance, unique dining experience and A+ food.  

Apparently if you're too shy to shout your drink order to a bartender in a busy restaurant like this, it's fair game to trash the place??! Let us all rememeber what Yelp is for... To give FAIR and honest reviews.. Not to leave one out of 3 lifetime reviews, that were all negative, hoping to get something for free.",5

However being unable to stand or walk has it's advantages, which means when the parents dine out... they bring you home presents. 
YAY ME! 
So I my to go order from The Cheesecake factory is what I am basing my review on ..
Chicken Piccata with Angel Hair pasta- was divine really a perfect combination of buttery and lemony flavors.. topped off with angel hair pasta. 

for dessert...Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake... excuse my inadvertant ""OHHH"" face ... so delicious. This absolutely made me being stuck at home in a chair or in bed ...just fine. 

In fact it made it bearable. 
an extremely tasty meal that was cooked to perfection and a cheesecake that was unbelievably.... heavenly.

If7xeTM3L__v9ezLT5IaLQ,"My first michelin-starred restaurant!!! My girlfriend took me here as a surprise, and what a surprise it was. I had honestly not heard of Guy Savoy before but just a brief google search found these accolades:

The Las Vegas restaurant has garnered 2 Michelin stars, the AAA Five Diamond Award, the Forbes Five Star Award, and the Wine Spectator Grand Award.

WOW! What a resume. As soon as I learned where I was going, suddenly my expectations shot up sky high. Never have been at a michelin-starred restaurant before, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect, but the French magicians here did not disappoint.

We checked in and were seated immediately. The waiters provided us every courtesy imaginable, some I had never seen extended before: firstly, ladies are given a stool for their purses. What? Even your purse gets a seat here. On the table are absolutely gorgeous salt and pepper containers, and the glassware you get for your drinks are just stunning. Between dishes, they will clear your table of any crumbs. Wow! I must be really showing my plebeian side right now. At the start of the meal, they will ask about any dietary concerns and time constraints. The service they provide just blew my mind. They are clearly on top of their shit. Even the restrooms are beautiful.

Now let's talk about the FOOD

1. Amuse bouche - Lobster candy, seaweed granite: Basically a single bite of lobster wrapped in seaweed. Slightly sweet with all the flavors of the lobster there. Great way to kick start your appetite.

2. Caviar, frozen cauliflower mousse - Imagine eating shaved ice, but it's actually cauliflower. Paired with caviar and skim milk skin, this reminds me more of a dessert than an entree, but extremely delicious nonetheless. 

3. Langoustine Tartare, Black Truffle Heirloom Carrot Petals,
Poached-Fried Quail Egg - Wow! The presentation of this dish just exceeded all my expectations. They pour some water underneath the dish where it hits some dried ice and creates a very beautiful steam effect. Pictures don't do this any justice TBH. The dish itself is very good. Can't go wrong with quail eggs.

4. Salmon Iceberg - This was almost more of a show than a meal, and boy I was loving it. The executive chef came out with a cart of goodies, then prepared one piece of salmon for each of us by seasoning it on a BLOCK of Himalayan pink salt. He explained that he wanted us to see how the salmon tasted just by itself (it was amazing). After that he prepared one more piece each. He took the salmon and SEARED it right in front of us on a block of dried ice. Wow. I didn't even know you could do that. After it's seared, they place it on your plate and pour a hot broth on top so you can taste the contrast of the cold and the heat. I regret not getting a video of the whole process because it was such an amazing experience.  

5. Sea bass, crispy scales, sauerkraut, and kusshi oyster - Both the sea bass and oyster are extremely flavorful. Just by itself, it's extremely moist and soft. With the scales and sauerkraut, you get the crunchy texture. 

6. Foie gras, pickled turnip, bellota ham-quince infusion - To be honest, I don't think I've ever had foie gras before. My god, it's like a crazy cross between butter and steak. I heard it was illegal in California (where I'm from) till recently, so I will definitely be seeking more out! Wow, so good.

7. Artichoke and black truffle soup, toasted mushroom brioche and black truffle butter - Uh, thinkin' out loud.. black truffle butter is so crazy good. Paired with the brioche, wow. Then pair THAT with the black truffle soup, wow.

8. Pan-seared quail, stuffed baby turnip, and smoked sabayon - My vote for the cutest dish here. The meat is extremely flavorful and succulent. The baby turnip is cut so you can pop halves of that sucker into your mouth. The quail was deboned, then REboned for presentation lol. I think that's pretty cool. The sabayon just adds so much flavor on top of that. 

9. Japanese Wagyu, sesame seed, and terragon crust, artichoke salad and barigoule, sponge cake - The dish's presentation is very clean but actually there is so much going on here. The artichoke salad and sponge cake combo is not something i've ever experienced before so that was very interesting. The wagyu was pure bliss. I'm not an expert meat connoisseur but even a guy like me and tell the difference between a high quality cut like this and everything else.

10. Black Truffle Cromesqui: You just pop that sucker in. It's suppose to be eaten in a single bite!

11-14. Desserts + dessert cart. Sorry as much as I'd love to describe these to you all, I hit yelp's character limit. Let's just say they don't suck. 

Closing thoughts - This was the best meal I've ever had in my entire life. It's no surprise that this restaurant is so highly decorated in awards. If you are fortunate enough to be able to afford an evening, I highly recommend it. Seriously a memory for a lifetime.",5
RcAbz871X_DA1burRnijbQ,"PROS: solid food, cool atmosphere, easy-going, good place for HH.

CONS: We (and others) made it a point to visit Opa's often for their live music, the biggest draw being THE SUGAR THEIVES. We have learned that Opa's owner - Jerry - has some issue with the band and that they will no longer appear at Opa. All we have to say is: BAD MOVE. You're about to enter the FUp Zone. Not a popular move as we, plus friends/family, always made it a point to spend the evening there (2-3 hours), eating/drinking/spending money as we listened to the band. We will (obviously) not be going to Opa Life if ST are not performing and possibly not for other bands. We WILL, however, be going to the venue where ST end up playing.

The food was marinated well. I always order their beef broth soup. Their potatoes were pretty dry, I would avoid them. We ordered a lot of red sausage, chicken, and beef. I would recommend ordering rice to provide counterbalance to the saltiness of the meat and marinade.

The price was standard for weekend dinner, although I would rank Chako better just for its bigger room and atmosphere.",3

wVEksNizkNGjrZyLEg8zYg,"The food was good but the service was pathetic. My girlfriend orders a side of mashed potatoes. The server delivers fingerling potatoes. We explain we ordered mashed not fingerlings. He comes back and indicates we are wrong, mashed potatoes aren't on the menu. I'm thinking maybe this guy just traveled trough a wormhole in space and landed at our table. We ask to borrow the menu from the table next to us and point out they are on the menu. He sees and leaves, leaving the fingerlings. We sit wondering what's going on. I wanted to jam my fork into the fingerlings but Jane loves her mashed. I'm thinking maybe this is a test if we eat them, we pay for them. The waitress doesn't come back so we have to wave her over. She tells us the mashed are on the way. I say, Jane is finished with her meal, please just take them off the bill. Both plates are now finished and the server places the mashed potatoes next to the fingerlings we didn't order. Two empty plates with a full order of fingerlings and a bowl of mashed sitting on our table. The dude from space finically clears the table. The bill comes and the mashed potatoes are on the bill. I point it out. Waitress says we didn't charge you for the fingerlings. I say that's nice we didn't order them. I asked the mashed be taken off as they came after the meal. I could tell she was right about to ask us if we ate them. She removes them from the bill like she did us a solid.
The bill comes on a hand held device with the option to tip between 15-20%. No option to customize the tip. I was going to actually tip 10% since they did actually serve the food. I'm forced to tip 15%....insult to injury.",1

_GivQvmYmMBwCWsenTeWmg,"Aria has its own coffee shop near the entrance from the self-parking garage called The Roasted Bean. Although this is the same Roasted Bean brand as it is in the Mirage (hence it was carried over), I find this to be a little bit nicer. Perhaps because it is newer, and perhaps because they charge more but the pastries / muffins and the coffee here just taste better for some reason despite being only a few doors away from the Mirage.

The coffee is expensive, two soy lattes (one small, one large iced) will cost you a whooping $13+ some change. If you want a muffin, it will cost you $4+ some change. This is not a place for the light hearted coffee drinker. You have to love. your. coffee. and need it badly enough to pay for it here when you can easily find an Illy in Palazzo or Coffee Bean in the Venetian. 

However, the staff was friendly, the coffee was good (they serve Illy coffee here ... ""premium"" I suppose) and despite the price, no complaints.",3

9x0ZphrRoGa2xEp5_eWA6g,"I had never been to Logan's before but went with a group of eleven people. I'm giving them two stars only because they were so accommodating and the manager was top notch. Otherwise, the story goes south.

Our waitress brought us drinks and that seemed to be the only thing she was really capable of doing. I know it was noisy, but she couldn't seem to hear anything we said and we had to repeat all of our orders repeatedly.  I ordered a Pepper jack Cheeseburger that comes with onion straws, so I asked for ""No Onions"", and a sweet potato. My husband had the meatloaf with broccoli and sweet apples. The waitress took our order and then refilled our drinks.

She delivered our food, and we didn't see her again until she presented the bill.  We had to ask other people going by for more silverware, for enough bread and butter for the ""whole"" table and when we were done eating we snagged someone else to carry away some of the plates. Never did she come by to see if our food was prepared correctly, and NO mine was not good.  My Medium Well Burger started out with a huge pile of onions...didn't I order without onions?  In peeling them off it took most of the cheese, which was distinctly NOT pepper jack cheese.  I cut the burger in half, and hmmmm Medium Well should NOT be deep pink inside, and when I ordered I specifically said NO PINK which she repeated back to me. My sweet potato was really good, but was so burnt that I could only eat about half of it without getting the charred skin, so was very disappointing, and it was really small.  The lady next to me had one that was easily 3 times as big as mine, and she got two sides, I only got one side because I got a burger.  My husband had the meatloaf, which he said was very flavorful and he enjoyed it, but it was hard to eat because it fell apart when he cut into it, and without a spoon it was a bit hard to eat. 

The manager came to the table when our meals were mostly finished, thank god for bread because my meal consisted of the part of the hamburger that wasn't pink and half of a small sweet potato. He asked how things were and I guess he could tell by my face that I wasn't happy because he stepped right up and offered to have a new meal prepared, which I declined as everyone was already done eating, but he comped my meal which did make me happy.

I will go back and try them again, because I realize that one meal does not mean they are bad, and everyone else seemed to enjoy what they had to eat.",2

SDly53rbKf7FYdYcJOFq8Q,"SOOO barriques. As some of you may know... I FREAKIN LOVE BARRIQUES. I must hold down my excitement to review this particular location though. Barriques coffee, tea, and treats? EXCELLENT

This particular location has a lot going for it and some not so much. The things I like most about it, is the location and the interior. This location is found right smack dab on the corner of Fish Hatchery Road and Park Street which is a HUGELY traveled intersection near downtown Madison. Plenty of sitting space, some comfy chairs and even a darkened area that seems... I don't know, quaint. It isn't super busy every time I have been here but it isn't dead either. Staff has been sometimes inattentive and once or twice downright rude but it only happened once or twice so I won't hold it against them. They also have an internet area in the back I think. I tend to stay toward the front of the store so I am not sure but I thought that was a really nice addition. 9 out of 10 times the store is spotless and finally it isn't cramped.

Now onto some not so nice things (Sad Face). So the things I dislike most about this location are 1. the bathroom, and yes I know it seems mundane but if you read some of my other reviews this can make or break it. It isn't always as clean as it could be to put it nicely. 

Another issue I have, Ironically enough, is the location. I know I said I enjoy the location and I do but it is right on the main drag so if you are there on a nice summers day or around 8:00, 12:00, or 4-6:00, all you will see is bustling traffic. Which, if you are trying to relax, is not the first thing that springs to mind. The other issue is that it doesn't seem to be as busy as it should be for being where it is. Why isn't that place packed all day! The reason I have found for this is that there is not much parking without walking a bit, which is great in the summer maybe or if your younger, but not so much in the winter. There is street parking but it is regulated so much that you would end up moving your car anyway. They have about 6 spots along the back of store but thats it.

So because I love their coffee and atmosphere so much this place gets a difficult 5 stars. The reason if because I don't want to have to park on a greatly busy street and cleanliness of the bathroom. Otherwise? Great staff, Free WiFi, Great coffee, Great Decor, Great Food, And Great Coffee... Oh did I say they had Great coffee too?",5

B7GOxqKGeynxkwI5BpvHjQ,"Came here today. Gelato overall was okay. Nothing really too good or too bad. It was actually little bit too creamy for my taste. But I really enjoyed the passion fruit, kiwi, and espresso flavours. The two stars are for the following reasons:

1. The watermelon flavour tasted very very fake. We threw out the whole scoop 

2. We got two of the three flavour sizes in cups. The portions were generous but the gelato was melting everywhere. I wanted to get a small cup on the side to carry the overfill but was told we had to pay 50cents. Seriously, how cheap can a store get? Almost makes me wonder if they cheap out on the gelato ingredients as well

3. The washroom sink had no knobs... almost broke my thumb trying to wash my hands

4. The gelatos looked like they were melting in the display case. It's not even a very hot day. Looks sort of gross, which should've been our first cue to leave. Nevertheless, will not visit again.",2

This guy Zac was the worst I had a horrible experience and it is not over yet I dropped my car off on Oct 3 of this year and right from the beginning there was no communication he told me he would give me an update in a week, that week went by and I had to call him. He informed me that he had not even started on my car car because he did not like my claims adjuster at Progressive. I stated maybe I should take my car since that is who I have insurance with. He said no he would get another adjuster there. Another week went by no call, on to the third week he answers but tells me it will be another couple days. I got my car almost 4 weeks later he then tried to tell me I owed him $1000 for a deductible I guess he thought I was crazy because I am female. I stated to him he was incorrect, but had i not known this information he would have tried to get that amount. When i drove my car home and parked it, there was fluid come from everywhere. He refuses to take the car back and stated to the insurance i refused to bring it back. He also lost my alarm key, and my car was gone through from the glove compartment to the trunk when i asked him about things missing he stated that I signed the clause in the contract that stated if anything is lost or stolen their shop is not responsible. My advice is to be careful when searching for a body shop. I am still dealing with issue and it is over a month later!

If you're used to middle of the road, chain Mexican food places, and get freaked out at the thought of anything deviating from that path, this place might be a bit too authentic for you. But, if you've been to Mexico, love the real stuff, and might even venture from the enchilada and burrito safe haven, this restaurant has your name on it. It's clean, bright and beautiful, very comfortable, very family friendly, and completely delicious. It has the requisite burritos and tacos and enchiladas, but it has so much more, for those who crave it. Great service, very friendly staff.

BImkdYGGyPLDAlQFXSXLiQ,"This is my new go to place for movies.  We typically find the $5 GroupOn deal and it is way cheaper than the regular movie theater and less crowds.  If there is a movie we really want to see, my hubby reserves our seats online - can't use GroupOn.  We have always gotten there early so that we are not stuck with the office chairs.  We typically get the reclining seats.  We love that we can order drinks and food and they serve to us.  No more of the balancing act with drinks and popcorn at the regular theater.  The food is decent - they offer appetizers, salads, burgers, chicken strips, etc.  They do make an effort in having a healthier menu by offering fresh fruit, salad, cheese and fruit plates.  Sometimes they are very heavy handed with the butter - they butter the buns for hotdogs and burgers...just tell your server light or no butter.  They also serve alcohol.  Their food and drink prices are definitely lower than iPic, but are comparable to YardHouse pricing.  The service is great and a great place for a date night.",4

At $15.99 the lunch Buffet is expensive but has a lot of items, however taste is missing in most. it leaves a lot to be desired.

Only because they make you give a rate this dump receives a star! These scam artists Greystar and the people that they have working for them are worse than a used car salesmen. Alana is the most ghetto unprofessional person that I've come across and unable to resolve conflict but I guess that's not part of your job description. But being extremely rude, condescending and hanging up in people's face is. I go in to sign my lease and Alana and her coworker where rushing around to try and get my lease together and I should have payed attention to the signs that were around me, with two tenants turning in keys to get up out of this place... maybe it's the black mold that keeps popping up in the the toilets there or in your bedroom window seal regardless how many times you bleach,spray, and paint over it! For them to go over every addendum in the lease with me but not go over a rent increase is beyond me and then try to insult me by saying, ""Oh you didn't read your lease before you signed, well it's a legal document and binding so I don't have to talk to you!"" And hang up in my face. This is what this lady ( and that's a stretch ) Alana did! This is what represents Greystar  Stonebridge Ranch I moved in and felt like wow this company got it right!  But now I see that you are not employing people that are detailed oriented or can resolve issues. Oh no I guess that was her way of so called handling the problem!? No, no and no!

To have to my coworkers coming up to me asking me what's wrong because I feel like the place I call home is not a home and that I've been scammed! I would think  twice if there was a thought of coming to live here, where they don't hold the tenants with pets accountable for there pets using all the grass areas as a liter box so you can't even enjoy sitting a blanket out and reading a book, where they have done nothing about this infestation of stray cats this is just sad and I hate that I put my trust in a place that's ran by scam artist and disrespectful people!",1

-1TbLd55GPDYmJOlDRSR4A,"I LOVE this restaurant. I've lived in Vegas 20+yrs, and used to frequent the Villa Pizza in Green Valley back in the 90's. If they've changed at all, it's for the better (which is hard to do). The pizza is great, but the PASTA?....you can't get any better for the price! They used to have a really nice sports bar/ dining establishment on S. Durango, and I wasn't sure this humble looking new place would ""measure up"" to the outstanding food they served there....my worries withered away when I ordered the lasagna, my long-time favorite, and for the first time, rigatoni al la carmine. Now the only trouble I have is deciding which to order!!! 
From the flavor of the dishes, to the portion sizes, to the price, you can't beat Carmine's for neighborhood Italian food.

Note: the bad reviews on here prompted me to right a review (my 1st). Those reviews really seem unreasonably harsh and unforgiving. Even if I received ""less than perfect"" service, I'd try and remember no one is 100% ALL the time! Also these guys have ""hit the mark"" every time I visited, so....give them a shot, you'll be happy you did!",5
cEMqkGm4LVL-ZbNGf43o8Q,"4 stars for the actual venue, but my overall experience when I came here on Friday, 12/30/11 is what gives this place 5 stars in my book.  Hands down THE BEST Vegas nightclub experience I've ever had.  Yeah, this beats my LAX experience and I didn't even get anything for free.  I'm a girl in Vegas and I'm not bitching about not getting things for free, that's how much fun I had.

Laidback Luke spun that night.  I bought presales online 2 days prior to the event.  Girls were $20 and guys were $30.  My ""group"" consisted of those awful uneven boy-girl ratios that makes it hard to get in anywhere in Vegas and it was just me, my brother, and my boyfriend.  

My flight was delayed we didn't get to Aria until 11:30.  There's a line for pre-sales at the main floor and then when you went downstairs to Haze, there was another line for everyone to get in.  Considering it was almost midnight and the fact that I was with 2 guys, I was surprised at how quickly we got in.  Hassle-free, I might add.

Minus half a star for the main dance floor being freakishly small.  But they get that half star back for having 2 bars, with one of the bars being practically empty.  We stayed at the second bar for most of the night because there was a lot of space to dance in that area and you could still hear the music.

I don't remember how much I actually spent at the bar but I do know that the drinks cost less than at XS or Marquee and the wait for a drink didn't take as long.  So there's another plus.

Once Laidback Luke came on, we found a spot literally right behind his DJ booth and there was practically no one around us to get in our way or step on us.  It was AMAZING!  So much room to dance, I couldn't believe it!  Granted we were posted up in kind of like a hallway but we had a clear view of him and all of the amazing lights, the music was still hella bumping, and the security guards weren't making us move to get out of the way because the space was huge.  I danced my happy ass off until 3AM for the first time in a long time.  It helped that I didn't wear heels.

Another plus is that they actually have a coat check.  I didn't need to use it because we came from our hotel straight to the Aria via cab but for those Vegas winter nights where I go out to have dinner or watch a show and THEN go to the club, a coat check is perfect.  

One last plus:  I saw Eric Stonestreet (Cam from Modern Family) partying and dancing his butt off at the VIP tables.  First random major celebrity sighting of my life and I'm so glad it was Cam and he was dancing like crazy to LBL.  A GREAT, PERFECT NIGHT!",5

The salon itself was very well kept and designed. And every staff member was very friendly. 

I had the stylist Colleen. To put it simply, she's awesome!! I hadn't had my hair cut in a really long time and she worked with me, listening to me and adding her input when I asked for it. The results: my hair looks amazing! She taught me how to do the style myself while she was blowdrying it and then again afterwards. The cut and style cost only $50 too, you can't beat that!

It was a 4+ hour job moving heavy furniture and boxes upstairs to a condo and a stop at storage up 2 flights of stairs. No complaints, no breaks (just enough time to down some water) and price was as quoted. They would see my neighbors walking up and automatically stop (with a smile) and ask if they should move the truck, before my neighbors even had a chance to ask. They made such a good impression my neighbors kept talking about them and wanted to know who they where so they could use them for their next move.

This is what the owner said to my mom, someone who has been going to Angela Nails for 6 years! 

My Mom has been to this location for 6 years and she was going back home to Europe so she booked her appointment 2 days before leaving! She got shellac on her fingernails and toenails to help them last for the trip. 
When she got home, within a few hours some of the polish on her hands started chipping off. She called to have them fix it and they told her they are so busy but asked her to come 15 minutes before the shop opened! 
They were so rude to her at the shop telling her ""this has ever happened before"" "" you just didn't like the colour"" ""we are so busy here we don't have time for this"" "" we don't need your business, we are busy""

7o0xyHLZonh_QB1IrXKOpA,Tried the latte here. Came topped with heart foam art which was cute. But I didn't really like the latte itself. It didn't taste smooth. There was this burnt taste to it. Tried the drip coffee. Didn't really like it either. If I  had a better grasp of coffee language I might be able to explain why I didn't like it but I don't. If anything it tasted acidic and I guess I like a more smooth rounded roast. The butter tart i had was delicious though. And the atmosphere of the whole cafe is really nice. One can easily spend an entire day here.,3

So came here to really relax and you sure can when you see their booth seating, on the left, which is separate from the U-shaped bar when you first walk in.  total casual setting and heritage-like feel.

amazingly, haven't had any ribs since I've been here, and it was either that or the nachos but thought the ribs would be a better option in terms of digestion lol.

very yummy bbq sauce, made in-house, and meat cooked to perfect tenderness, literally falling off the bone.  Even a half-rack's good enough.  Comes w/ garlic toast.

I had the yellowtail roll for an appetizer (fresh and delicious) and the Cioppino for my entree.  The Cioppino had a ton of mussels, lobster, shrimp, scallops and white fish in a nice tomato broth with shaved fennel and Israeli couscous.  My only issue was the pieces of white fish were practically inedible. Salt block city! If I would have eaten all the pieces they'd given me, I would have left on a gurney.

tKZh5uNtiK5aYbicaDJeXA,"I ordered delivery from BCF after reading favorable reviews from this site.

The butter chicken (breast) was delicately spiced, with sweet, rich sauce. 

The rice pullao with peas was very flavourful.

The eggplant bharta had interesting blend of flavour; lots of tomatoes and onions. Eggplant is not a favourite of mine but this dish was quite enjoyable. 

My favorite Indian restaurant is still Babur at Queen St. but it would be worthwhile to try other dishes at BCF.

Skip the greasy samosas though.

Low marks though for delivery service. I was told that delivery will take 1 hour but we ended up waiting for 2 hours.",3

Come on, you are not Hugh Hefner. He was probably at the pool nearby, but just throw on a shirt, not your bathrobe.

At any rate, on to the great gelato. Wife and I ordered the watermelon gelato, and it was heaven in our mouths. Never had I tasted such fresh, light, sweet, delightful gelato. It literally tastes like chilled, fresh, soft watermelon. It is about five bucks here, but worth every penny.",5

Started out good with super friendly wait staff, but when we had to ask three separate servers for more cocktail sauce we started to get disappointed.  We were going to go see Rod Stewart last night, so were kind of distracted.  The server recommended prime rib since they offer that on show night.  When she said it was market price and $48, I think we really didn't hear that part.   Expecting an enormous slab of meat with lots of potatoes and veggies, we were surprised to get an average size of meat and two small discs of potato along with 8 asparagus sprigs.   Granted it tasted good, but not $48 good.   No salad or soup offered as part of the meal or even bread.  To top it off, our friends ordered Shepard Pie and it was so small we thought it was out mashed potatoes!   They said it was extremely tasteless and were extremely disappointed.  I'm only giving 2 stars because the ambience was nice and the dessert was the best part of the meal.  Oh yea, calamari was just ok.   Not a great impression Chef Ramsey.",2

We all ordered something different and all decided we would try each other's meal when we returned.

They even brought me a vegan menu and the super nice  chef came out to chat with me about recommendations! He was even willing to make something off the menu. The menu was already filled with tempting options. I had the freshly made bread (the spices were a stand out!) with hummus, fried mushrooms and -- wait for it -- the crispiest, juiciest flash-fried Brussels sprouts! No wonder these were such a hit; we kept seeing servers carrying multiple orders to various tables. I also had a hearty veggie soup, decadent falafel bites and ended up taking a watermelon frisée salad to go. I already knew this place was going to be the hit -- the second you walk in, the aroma from the bread and antipasti bar greets you with a warm welcome. (Don't go biting the air now!) I highly recommend the flash-fried Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, bread + hummus (not your typical, so don't get it twisted) and watermelon frisée salad. You'll be full, don't worry. I want to go back to try the kale salad and more of the vegan options! I love this place and can't wait to get dolled up and dine here again. I'll stop and let the photo speak for themselves.",5

This brunch is focused around seafood and they have a ton of great options! On the serve yourself buffet, I really enjoyed the lobster (each tail was cut into 4ths), huge shrimp cocktail, octopus poke, tuna poke and smoked salmon. I also sampled some of the salads which were nice and light. 

Additional options on the buffet included a craving station with prime rib and sausage and made to order omelets. They also had a huge dessert table.

I did order a few made to order plates and my favorites were the slider, very juicy, and the orange choc chip pancakes. The pancakes were a perfect ""dessert"" to my meal.

The service I received here was up to par with the price tag. Everyone was very attentive. My waitress paid attention and was ready to offer me another prosecco when I was close to done with my current.

When we check in the man at the counter tells us we were guaranteed two queen beds because we have 3 people. No, that's not what I payed for or reserved and showed him my reservation.  There was attitude from him.  He got on the phone reluctantly to ""try"" and find us a king bed.  He did, 3rd floor, backing to a busy street on the god damned dog floor with little yappy dogs in the room next door to us.

I asked her why he didnt try ringing the doorbell, and she said he knocked and that knocking should have been good enough. When I told her I had received no missed calls and asked her when they could try to re-deliver the pizza, she said we would have to wait ANOTHER couple hours because the driver had already come out once and that we were going to be put at the end of the line. When I asked to speak to the manager, she of course said that the manager had already gone home for the day. This woman made no effort to make this right. 

I told her that waiting another two hours was ridiculous because we still hadn't even received our pizza. We cancelled our order and decided to never use Angelina's Pizza again. What's to boot, is that we got charged over the phone for a pizza that we never even received.

hH-UZY-dKksJ1fKtxh6Xcg,"We had a meeting with the Property Manager today and feel that our concerns were satisfactorily resolved.

Mis-communication seemed to be the primary issue, especially with move-in date and times - we were shown the ledger that proves we were pro-rated for 10/1. 
The lease was not ready because the VP only comes in to sign them once per week - which we didn't know and now understand. 
The vinyl flooring was supposed to start on Thursday when we were home and was not supposed to take 3 days to complete - this was an issue with the individual performing the work and not communicating with the front office at Lincoln Ridge. 

Terrence also said the carpets will also be re-cleaned - the spots and stains are due to the replacement of appliances post carpet shampoo'ing, but pre our move-in. Maintenance items noted on our walk-through are due to be addressed today, and the carpet is scheduled for later this week.

I am extremely happy with this resolution of events. Terrence was professional in addressing my concerns and we now have open avenues of communication to ensure that misunderstandings do not arise in the future. 

To review the property itself: the apartment is spacious and lovely, the fire place is a great bonus, and my balcony overlooks some woods so it's very scenic and peaceful. I paid for an upgrade package to get all new stainless steel appliances and brushed nickel fixtures - highly recommend, it really makes a difference. You can hear water running in the pipes all over the building, but that's normal. We very rarely hear our neighbors, despite some other reviews to the contrary. The dumpsters are very messy, with individuals dumping furniture and mattresses and trash all over the ground. This isn't really Lincoln Ridge's fault, but the caliber of people who will leave a mess like that is the type of people you will be living with.

whYTXUIpqDPT3tE4sKhxWw,"Great Atmosphere, Good Food, Not The Most Attentive Service...

So to start things out with the most positive... This is an nice little spot hidden just off the main roads but quite possibly overlooked. 

The atmosphere is clean and inviting with a nice dimly lit environment that prepares you for a relaxing meal. 

We found this place in Groupon where there was a $40 gift certificate for only $20 which makes trying a place out motivational!

We arrived and were promptly seated in the back room in the corner. I came to the conclusion that the staff doesn't notice you often in the corner....

Water is refilled at half cup by the roaming water fillers... 

The food was a solid enjoyable 4 of 5 stars... it was tasty and good, but not an explosion of greatness... definitely worth the price and the visit. 

Ordering desert requires more than 10 minutes of watching the waiter visit each table but ours as I waved and attempted to gain his attention.... finally he came ask we asked for the dessert menu but here is no actual menu so he verbally gave it to us... We ordered two desserts and coffee to end the night.

Getting coffee wasn't easy... the desserts came out and still no coffee. After a bit the waiter said he was making some coffee for us and then it arrived. Then we had to wait for real sugar since they brought a tray of chemical sugar substitutes that we wouldn't use...

p6NSB8Bv-n7RVTkT_eUEaA,"So...everyone has heard of this place by NOW right?? This restaurant is fantastic and that's probably why it's been part of the Strip scene since 1972.

The atmosphere is unique....unique in a way that reminds me of the Stardust days and vintage Vegas. Their menu even says ""some things are better left unchanged"" and when it comes to what they do at The Peppermill, they're right! They don't need to change a thing and if they ever did, it may be the worst move ever.

The menu is extensive, and the portions are LARGE and i mean LARGE. It's done on purpose to replicate what Vegas used to do before greed by the ""big guys"" set in. The food is pretty awe-inspiring, and seemed pretty robust in quality. The ambiance alone gets the 5-stars.

If you go to Vegas and don't try the Peppermill, you'd be doing yourself a great disservice and it may even result it a display of your own penitence.

Note: The company that owns Peppermill also has a Peppermill Casino in Reno, Western Village Casino in Sparks, and operates a small Casino called Rainbow Club in Henderson.",5
hy0ZD5r7qswnCmxWT57e3g,"At first we were promised all kinds of incentives & such from an office worker. Come to find out she told us wrong, but the manager was nice enough to stand behind their word. Our apartment was unbelievably disgusting when we moved in. We were moving from Iowa, so you can imagine how a first impression is when you are promised everything was looked through TWICE and was supposed to be in ""mint condition."" 

The floors were brown downstairs, carpets had hair and safety pins in them, but were said to be shampooed, the dishwasher was replaced, but not measured because when you tried to open the door it broke the cabinet. The drawers were busted, drains clogged, outlet plugs are loose, blinds broken, patio not maintained and full of leaves/ tree is falling onto the back door. 

Our washer and dryer has been broken SINCE WE MOVED IN A MONTH AGO! They tried to fix it once and did not work, so I sent in another order and 14 days later they came to check it out and nothing has been done. They said that if the first fix didn't happen they would order a new one. A new one should have been ordered in the first place since it should have been fixed when we moved in. BTW it's still not fixed. They said they would pay for us to do our laundry in the public area, but if we are paying rent to have it in unit then it should be fixed no later than 10 days. 

The back patio door had a lock on it from the last tenant. My dad is a firefighter and notified them that it is a safety hazard, because if there was a fire and we couldn't get out the front way, then we would be trapped because of the lock. He asked for it to be removed IMMEDIATELY. They took a day and would have been longer if my dad didn't go back up there and demand for it to be off, because the Fire Marshall would NOT approve of that. Utterly ridiculous that this was missed by 2 PEOPLE from a said inspection. 

Our washer and dryer has been broken for a month and our patio still has not been cleaned when promised for it to be done today. Promises have not been kept and it is such a shame when you move from somewhere having such high hopes.

My last landlord had over 500 properties in Iowa City and if we put a maintenance request in they would have it fixed by 5 days AND came the next day. Not to mention they only had 2 maintenance guys handling all 500 properties. So what's the deal Arcadia 4127? Why can't you come within 10 days to fix something? I don't see any logical excuse if 2 maintenance men can manage 500 properties and answer to request in 5 days OR LESS!

Also, nothing but paying for our laundry has been compensated for countless conversations and the headache of something that should have been taken care of before we moved in. I have dealt with crappy management/landlords before (places with black mold) and those landlords were much better with responding and to deal with. 

The townhouses are nice if everything gets fixed and should have been fixed, but beware if something breaks... the likelihood of it getting fixed is very slim.",1

Apparently the whole batch had been undercooked and no one had noticed before sending it out. We kept having to flag people down because all of the servers were frantically moving about the restaurant. We expected to have been compensated in some way, but NOTHING was taken off of the bill. It was ridiculous. The only saving grace was that our waiter was nice and tried his best to make up for the kitchen staff being behind. But for a restaurant old town Scottsdale I was NOT impressed. I will definitely not be going back.",2

t1iqzEX44rkj-ehLUCw3SA,"Horrible service. These guys are rude and unprofessional. 

I had forgotten to write a review about this company, because the day I dealt with them was just bad overall, but was fortunately reminded this morning when I drove behind one of their trucks. The jerk was in the carpool lane holding up traffic (for at least 10 miles - truck #110), but wasn't carpooling. 

The wait time was just over double what they quoted (I waited over an hour) and they didn't even call to tell me they would be late. Is it too much to ask for a courtesy call? Every other company I've dealt with has. Running late, fine, just call me and let me know so I don't think I've been abandoned. And I originally went with them because they quoted me the shortest wait time. Don't fall for this. They give you a short wait time, but didn't deliver. And I didn't even get a ""Sorry, I was busy and running late.""",1
04CsCdgQsbt51rnbo983fA,"Dingier than last time I was there 5 years ago (it is in a basement after all). Wynn beats the pants off it. 

The options here are plentiful, but the drink service was super slow and we were seated in an area and they were cleaning around us during our meal with a janitor cart. It kind of spoiled the mood. They had sports on TV, which as an Olympic fan, I enjoyed.

Some of the strengths here are the middle eastern booth, the desserts, and the italian booth. There was an interesting lamb stuffed tomato that I loved. 

Some of the misses are the Asian buffet (looked like it had been out there all day), the seafood line (put the busiest thing in the corner where the most people jam in?) and the quality of the mexican ingredients. 

Good if you get the 24 hour pass and need a place to eat all day. Otherwise, take the cab up to the Wynn or cross to Bellagio. I think you'll enjoy spending your 30-40 there more.",3

Overall, I just have some serious hair anxiety...

But! Planning hair appointments around my travelling was getting old, so I made an appointment here. Boy, am I glad I finally tackled my fear of new hair salons with this place.

The best part of this airport restaurant is the location. It's right there and has a great crowd and the seating is spread out, with many large screen tvs. 

And the food wasn't too shabby either. I'd go back. The mac n cheese was good - missing some breadcrumbs, but whatev. And the salad was yummy. The sandwiches were ordered were good too.

But the highlight and memorable item.... all sandwiches come with fries, onion rings, or..... FRIED ZUCCHINI STICKS. yum! perfect and crispy, with a great dipping sauce. Perfect sports bar item.

Service wasn't bad for us - slow perhaps - but the workload our server had was incredible. One man for the entire outer area seating, way too much for him, but he managed it well and was nice too.",4
8o_NUUEPMe_TwDIWj44Hyg,"This place is really amazing. I come here for brunch or dinner pretty much every Vegas trip I go on and I've got to say that it's been consistently good. 
The wine list is pretty stellar and the bar tenders are really knowledgeable about what pairs with what and they do their best to give you tastes before you buy. The prices for wine vary from inexpensive to more than what I make in a week. I've never been disappointed by any of the wines OR cocktails that I've tried here. Which are numerous. 
Food: The FRIES!!! So good. They're the skinny little ones and they're wonderful. I got the mussels and fries and the sauce for the mussels was to die for! I also got the lamb over a bean ragout and I was disappointed with that dish. Way too much salt and the beans didn't make sense with the lamb- they were almost the same texture which was a little weird. The lamb was so tender that it was almost shocking! We for sure finished that!
My friend got the scallop entree and it was phenomenal!! Seriously! Very rich though. It was small, only two or three scallops, but because of the richness, we couldn't eat any more than that anyways. 
We also got some mussels and clams as a starter and the sauces that came with them were outstanding. The prices were reasonable for cold seafood too. 
We also tried the french onion soup and I have to say, it's the best I've ever had. It's large though, so I could have eaten it for dinner alone!!!

We walked in and were greeted right away and quickly seated. After waiting 10 minutes someone casually dropped off 4 waters  but nothing else. At this point we had waited 15 minutes but still had no idea who our waiter was. We finally asked the lady in the front to be moved into another section and she quickly sat us somewhere else. After that we had to wait another 20 minutes for food and finally ate after what felt like forever. This was an awful experience and the manager came over and just apologized and walked away. He didn't say anything else, didn't ask us if we needed anything. It was  a very disappointing experience especially because we have eaten here many times before. On the bright side the food was good.",3
InOab0vfmiRg5eoWsNcSJw,Went to the happy hour this afternoon with my husband and we were very disappointed in the bad service and terrible food.  We were trying to decide between Lush Burger and Red Robin -- should have gone with Red Robin.  The $6.00 happy hour margarita tasted like straight collins mix.  First time in my entire life that I have sent a drink back to the bar!  We each ordered burgers medium rare and and after a long wait of about 20 minutes our food arrived.  Burgers were overcooked hockey pucks on large untoasted brioche buns.  They only gave us one little portion of ketchup to share.  We asked for mayo and ranch and the server only brought us one of each to share.  When the server asked how our food was I showed her my burger and she said she was sorry that it was overdone and if I wanted to send it back.  I passed since we had already been there such a long time.  $40 is a alot to spend on poor food and terrible service.  No one from management ever came to our table to follow up on our complaint about the drink or the burgers.  This place is awful and I wouldn't be surprised it it went out of business soon.  Never again.  Don't waste your time and money on this lousy place.,1
rOfNn3Aqxi2AUwwKCFbIfg,"My husband and I wandered in to Showcase Honda one Saturday without an appointment or anything but with just one particular Honda in mind. We got there around 11am and we were on our way home in our beautiful Honda around 1:30pm. Within those 21/2 hrs, we test drove a couple of cars, chat with our sales rep about pros and cons of choosing one between two cars, took care of the financing arrangements and got info on all the little perks that came with the purchase. It's been 6 months since we got our Honda, and I just dropped my car off at the service center for an oil change and software update plus a bonus wax coating that came with the deal (we'll get free waxing every 6 months for 5 yrs). During the servicing, you can wait in the reception area or you could walk to Starbucks on 16th street to have a little latte while you wait for your car. I love the convenience!

Yeah, we're very satisfied with our Honda experience at Showcase Honda. They're very helpful:)",5
ApOeX9GlEPdPmsiIbgt24w,"Yay! Finally a Hawaiian BBQ place closer to where I live. I hated driving so far just to get some from Maui Rose on Tropicana. 

Apparently this place had been under construction and is now RE-OPEN. The restaurant is huge and roomy with the old American diner look. You have the option of sitting by the counter on stools or in the little booths with the cushion chairs! There was AC too so I felt supeeer comfy. 

The menu they have offer a lot of things that typical hawaiian bbq places do, from the BBQ combination platter, spam musubi, BBQ burger, etc. They also offer a ""Atkins"" menu for low carb eaters, and a section if you would like to switch out for brown rice instead. They have 2 sizes in which you can order, the ""mini"" or the ""regular"". The mini comes with only one scoop of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad, the regular comes with 2 scoops of rice and 2 scoops of macaroni salad. *this is what the cashier told me so correct me if I'm wrong!*

I ordered the BBQ combination plate which has the BBQ chicken, BBQ beef, and short ribs, the bf ordered the BBQ burger and spam musubi. We decided to eat at the restaurant so we could enjoy the AC and comfy chairs.

The tables have sriracha, and aloha brand Hawaiian soy sauce, yum! Our order came and I was surprised that the food still came in a styrofoam box even though we ordered to dine in, but oh well, it will be easier to take home leftovers. My food was delicious, so much meat and my macaroni salad was good also. I think my favorite was the BBQ beef, they were yummy and thin and flavorful, reminds me of the steak or brisket you get from pho haha.

My bf enjoyed his BBQ burger but enjoyed his spam musubi way more, he enjoyed it so much he tells me to make some so he can take to work now. Great, now I need to find a musubi mold and Hawaiian soy sauce. 

Service was good, though the cashier girl could smile a bit more or be a bit more cheerful? The gentleman was nice enough to give me a free refill, so woop woop! This place is going in my bookmarks so I can definitely come back here again. :)",4

We started with the lobster cocktail and it is huge. The lobster claws went past my expectations. And mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts with our 22 oz ribeye. 

The only bad thing is the location, it is right in the mall which I am not a fan of, but it is conveniently located on the strip. And the architecture is beautiful and modern.",5
4TNG8y5_T7kzGbcH2X8Ieg,"Dive bar, for sure.  I've only been at lunchtime - but the beer selection would not get me to come after work.  ANYWAY - I digress...

I'm a huge fan of the lunch specials.  A few of us from work come here like clockwork (yes, I'm betting you COULD set your watch based on our arrival) on Fridays.  Monday through Friday, they have 4 daily specials.  Sandwich and fries, or a salad for $5.  FIVE BUCKS.  Our pathetic little group consistently gets the french dip on Fridays.  Yes... all four of us.  

And, can I say it??  I would not typically order a salad from a dive bar.  I'd picture crappy veggies, and probably icky iceberg lettuce.  My girlfriend ordered a salad, and I was looking at it with lots of interest.  So much so that she started moving her plate closer to her side of the table.  :)  

The waitstaff is interesting.  The one regular girl is quick, and understands that we are on lunch, and hustles our stuff to us, and gets refills and checks out quickly.  Luckily, we usually get her. She's a cutie.  The OTHER girl... well... ummm...  yeah.  This past summer... she wore very VERY short jean skirts.  So short in fact, that when she came out onto the patio, walking towards our table, we could CLEARLY see her hot pink panties (god, I DETEST that word) flashing at us from under the skirt.  My buddy that was sitting eye level to her crotch as she came sashaying up to the table is still excited.  So, there ya go.  

If you go on a Friday, you'll see us there around 12:15.  We are a loud and happy bunch.  Say hi!  :)",4
rBuAENIHpNw0IYnlJdrOEA,"This review is for breakfast. The food and service were excellent compared to other casual restaurants on the Strip and for being in a hotel. First , the piping hot strong coffee comes in these large mugs which are perfect. The first day we had the All natural omelet made out of butter less egg whites and veggies (no meat) and the breakfast sandwich. Both were well prepared with quality ingredients and tasted delicious. The second day we wanted to come back for the French toast which looked amazing. We were not disappointed- full of butter and the right amount of sweetness and accompanied with warmed syrup (a nice touch). We also had the huervos rancheros which was full of marinated steak and no beans! The portions are just right and you won't leave being hungry. The prices are reasonable (for the strip and being in a hotel)...most of the entrees are $14-$17. Breakfast for two will run you about $40 plus tip. That may seem high but being from san francisco its wasn't that much that more.  Go to the Henry if you want quality, well executed food and service .",5
RgcSTO3EAa5xPuHqX3rdLQ,We came here with my sister and my brother in law. We love Korean bbq and this place didn't disappoint. We loved that there were several options of appetizers to choose from on the unlimited menu as well. My husband and brother in law loved the shrimp poppers the best. They probably had about 4 plates. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I ordered a corn cheese that I never received.,4
Z2_CvZf5sYfz__K02tkcuQ,"I am surprised at some of the low reviews of this place. I almost didn't try it which would have been a mistake.  The service was very friendly and a lot quicker than I had expected based on previous reviewers. The restaurant itself was clean, comfortable, and had a comfortable noise level in spite of being fairly busy.

The food was great and when it comes to variety can't be beat. I had the 1/3lb cheeseburger on a wheat bun. The bun was grilled and delicious but I had to forgo most of it otherwise I never would have been able to eat as much of the burger as I did. The medium size fries was too big for a party of two so next time I will try the small. We were also very happy to have the shakes and malts come in a half size which was much more manageable than the usual size you get in restaurants. 

We will definitely be back.",4

mBPtjRXc8MqB_h9hMSQyDA,"Decent place for sushi! Got the bento box dinner, and including tax and tip, the meal was under $20. 

First, we got miso soup (which I found to be too salty). The salad was good - pretty acidic but I like that. Then they gave edamame beans for the table (free appetizer, yay!).

The bento box itself was quite nice. I really like how it came with seaweed salad. I've never gotten that in a bento box before. It also came with half a spring roll. The salmon teriyaki was yummy - a bit burnt in parts, but the flavour and texture was good. I substituted the white rice for brown rice ($1 extra), which I enjoyed. The california rolls tasted a bit off...wasn't sure what it was about them. But it's enough for me not to order any california rolls from here if I ever come back. 

Tried some of the kalbi beef my friend ordered, as well as the tempura. Both were pretty decent.

They make their coffee products with coffee from Phil and Sebastian coffee roasters, which is a premiere coffee roaster from Calgary. Their service is quick and amiable every time, and I would not hesitate to recommend this spot for some good coffee. 

It's quite cozy inside, and it could (arguably) use more space, but there are two floors if the first floor is full. They also sell bags of coffee, from roasters like 49th Parallel (out of Vancouver), Cut Coffee Roasters (out of Toronto) and of course, Phil and Sebastian.

Dinner came with a little cup of ice cream for dessert, which was an unexpected delight.

So I have been to the Rx Boiler Room twice. The first time was with a large group of friends right around when it had just opened. We met Rick Moonen and his wife and tried almost everything on the menu. Had great service and great food. The place was hopping too. The steampunk theme is really cool, you want to just hang out. and have some weird cocktails. 4 STAR experience.
The second time, we had family in town and thought it'd be a fun place to take them. It was a Friday night around 7 and the place was surprisingly dead but the music was really loud, so don't expect to hold a decent conversation here. I tried to order one of their specialty drinks but were out of one of the ingredients...BOO! We ordered some apps and large plates. The thing I was most excited about getting again were the Chicken Pot Pie Nuggets. They were good, but something was different, I think it's the outside coating, they just didn't make me crave them again like they did the first time. We ate all of our food, it was good,...but just not as good as that first time. The service was so-so. 3 STAR experience. I'd tell you what we got and tell you how it was but I don't feel like it's worth my time or yours.
If you have to go, get a drink and maybe one app, snap some pictures. Then get out of there, Mandalay Bay is full of better places to eat.

This place is hidden in a group of buildings that look empty or closed during the weekend. Once in the parking lot, you think you're heading into a bar, but once in the door, a quick turn to the right and you're in Slidin' Thru HQ! 

It's colorful, full of surprises, video games, big screen TVs, graffiti on the walls, and today no one else around, we look over the small selection and make our choices of three: Barby, Captains order and Pep Pep, it seems this combination is ordered frequently, what better way to taste the difference and decide on your favorite? 

The least liked, Captains order, it was different, the arugula, feta cheese and balsamic reduction went well together, but I am an old fashion burger lover, so I want something simple. My favorite, Pep Pep, it's most like my idea of a burger, simple, bacon lettuce, tomato, onions, pickle, and sauce. 

Couldn't leave without trying some fries, the Captains order something different, fries, smothered with bacon, cheese, onions, and special sauce, it tasted like tartar sauce, something that would go good with my fish burger, I didn't really care for this. 

I know we'll be back, there are other things on the menu like the pulled pork and the sweet potato fries I want to try. At least I now know what to expect and if the Constancy is there, it'll be worth a return trip.",3

The problem, the math they used was SO off!  Our bill was $55.20.  They said 18% was $13.50, it's actually $9.94!  ($3.56 more!).  For 20% they said $15, it's really $11.04! ($3.96 more!) And for 22% $16.50, not the true $12.14! ($4.36 more).  Unbelievable deceit!  I have pix of receipt if anyone wants to see it.",2

ejIW9n3DGk4H7z5gKsTTBA,"Pretty decent ramen, despite its reputation of being ""the McDonalds of ramen joints"". I always know I can come here for a quick ramen fix for any cravings and come out satisfied. This location is faster in terms of service, as the dining area is greater than that of the location at Woodbine/ Steele's. I typically get the BBQ Pork Ramen ($1 more than the regular ramen for three extra slices of pork), and occasionally opt for the spicy version. The broth is consistently good, a little on the salty side, but the flavour is there. As for the noodles; perfect in texture if you ask me where it's not too chewy nor not too soft. I appreciate the abundance of toppings, like the corn, bean sprouts, and seaweed that come complimentary. However, the tea egg is hit or miss, where it sometimes comes completely done opposed to runny. Overall, a pretty great chain for that quick, affordable, and quality ramen craving fix!",4

COSZqaruA4uS4rnbkSOVXw,"Daves is really my love hate relationship. I ADORE having a food store this large in selection (can foods) within a few blocks of my house. I LOVE that they have a relatively good selection of meats, breads, canned goods. I LOVE that they are open when the market is not (because i can only get to the market on fridays and weekends- work schedule). 

I hate the costumer service i have gotten there EVERY single time. Especially in the Deli- prepare to wait a LONG time. I HATE that they have prices that are MUCH HIGHER THEN the west side market, the Athens Stores right around the bend and MUCH higher then anywhere else in the city. I HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HOW CRUMMY, and OLD, and CRAPPY their produce is. its A given that everything you buy will go bad VERY soon- much sooner then it should. Even within few days- and that is hard for someone who LOVES to cook Fresh.  They hold produce and fruit, on the shelf passed when most stores would not.  i have been so upset by the veggies and fruits that i have bought there, i actually started driving 20 mins down 90 to get to the Giant Eagle where EVERYTHING is cheaper, and FRESH IS FRESH. 

I love it and hate it. I can get anything i need last min in a recipe, but i hate going there. But i love supporting local store owners, so if i could choose, i would always go to the market. But sometimes you can't",1
oG-mFBMm4tiZm0LbZQ1IpA,"As this Walgreens is my regular drugstore, I chose this location to get a flu shot at.  When I arrived at the pharmacy there were no customers so I thought I'd be in and out in a breeze but 20 minutes later, I was still waiting for the shot.  After giving the first pharmacy employee my insurance information I was told to have a seat and that she'd get the paperwork that I'd needed to fill out in order to have the pharmacist give me the flu shot.  As another 10 minutes passed with no paperwork to fill out, I watched the 3 employees answer phones, help customers that walked in and those that came through the drive thru.  It truly was not busy, but it appeared that flu shots were not priority one, two or three to these employees.  Perhaps these employees/pharmacists value the service of flu shots as an intrusion on their time because it was clearly obvious that I was not an important customer to them.

After thirty-five minutes the paperwork was finally given to me and after another 10 minutes the pharmacist finally gave me a flu shot.

In summary, I came into the Walgreens at the corner of Higley & Williams Field to find no customers in the pharmacy area yet it took the staff 45 minutes to administer a flu shot,  My recommendation is that if you are looking for a place to get a flu shot, this location is not the one to come to.",2

FedwA8QHWsApJYEyJg4csQ,"I would have thought that a place called ""Beer Bistro"" would be right up in my wheelhouse.  I enjoy varied types of beer and love eating bistro-style food.  What's not to love?  And truly enough, the place has grown from fairly humble beginnings.  Rot iron and contemporary stools and tables await.  The staff are friendly and attentive, wheeling around the space armed with an understanding of the newly created gastro-pub menu (Did we really let the word ""gastro-pub"" sneak into our vocabulary?  Seriously?  Huh.  I don't like it.).  They are well aware of the pairings of food and beer that will make a good meal, and will also allow you to get a sampler of beers without resorting heavily on one pint.  Good points all around.

That's the good stuff.  The sense though is that this is a place to boast about the girth of your expense account.  As varied and numerous as the beers are, they are not cheap.  Mostly this is due to them maintaining the ability to provide a range of offerings.  But you can also add on an extra 10-15% onto the bottle and tap price based on the number of credit cards with company names punched into them that come forth for payments.  The food is tasty but can sometimes come off a bit pretentious for a place that has something as fun as beer as one of the ingredients.  All in all it's a fine place to go, but make sure someone else is paying for it.",3

Although they only had enough food to give the customers that arrived in the first half hour their orders, they continued taking orders for another 30 or 40 minutes. Then they announced that they were no longer taking orders and had run out of food. So we thought ""wow that was close!""  NOPE... 20 minutes later they told us they didn't have enough food for us either even though we had already ordered (along with 15 other people).

From Tokyo Tower, space needle, Shanghai Tower, Dubai tower and Taipei 101. Oh these towers are very tourism and  commercial. So how could do you know which one is the best? The most important things are customer service. In Tokyo Tower there are lots of activities and a very nice customer service. In space needle there's free photos for your memory and a good souvenir. In Dubai restaurants And cafes very awesome. 
Here in CN tower, My memory only stop at the worst customer service and very rude management. This disorganized tourist line.  Couple years ago me and my parents went to CN tower there are only two elevator going up, then we're waiting in line in hours. My parents are seniors and my mom disabled so I went to ask their managers why only one line is moving that our line is not moving at all? so the manager A blonde hair lady dress light gray suit and the light gray skirt, she said because we are as a group tourist should waiting more time than the people who buy their own ticket. Then I told her we been wait for this long line so long and our tour company only give us two hours free time, what if we cannot going up and stuck in the line. She said then I can return your money you don't really need to go up. Her snobby and rude explanation and that attitude always as a  Toronto landmark stuck in my memory. I love Toronto a nice city, but I always tell people to be careful to going up CN tower, maybe you'll get the same attitude as we did. Or maybe you were waiting in line for ever. As I said at beginning customer service is very important to your customer and your company. CN Tower management should go around the world check out the others service and management. Not far away at our East Coast in New York there a vampire state building served more customers all over the world. But I never felt wait that long in the line every time I go there",1

As far as the free Wi-Fi with drinks.  I am in full support.  The place has to make a business somehow and I think that 3 hrs is adequate.  What the baristas lack in customer service they make up in quality and expertise.  Their drinks are always perfect and they will mix up any drink imaginable. Take that Starbucks!  The place is almost always busy with customers in line so they must be doing something right.  My only request?

Went in to grab one of those overpriced cold press juices they have. I buy it on debit and leave.
I shake the bottle and all these moldy specks appear; I keep shaking and they don't disappear. Expiration date is two days ago. Apparently pulling rotten inventory from the fridge is not a priority here. 

Upon returning, the staff:

A. Don't know how to refund debit purchases at first and spend a few minutes texting for help. 

B. Eventually attempt to refund me the charged amount and not my 15% tip (I'll never again tip for a bottled beverage purchase EVER at a cafe again).

C. Very likely didn't refund me correctly since the refund amount hasn't appeared on my bank statement. EDIT: Hours later and no refund, which means they 100% straight up took my money for free.

So go to Tokyo Smoke if you want to have to inspect expiry dates with zero confidence that anyone here gives a crap either way, or only bring cash knowing full-well getting a debit refund won't happen, and also if you've been dying to spend 11.50 dollars and receive precisely 0.00 in return for it!",1

We went this past Sunday.  We had a reservation, which turned out to be a very good idea, because they were packed and had a few walk in's waiting for their turn for a table.

We got Brent again for our server.  BJ got a Snapper Head Butternuts and I got an Aloe Vera Lemonade which I thought was a perfect drink.  We started with an order of grilled bread with goat butter and rhubarb jam which I thought was perfect!  BJ got the short rib hash with poached egg and  horseradish hollandaise.  He thought the flavor was excellent!!  I got one of the specials which was chorizo quesadilla served with potatoes au gratin and pickled veggies and avocado cream.  So, so yummy.

I ordered the filet and shrimp and the shrimp was like rubber. It tasted like it wasn't cooked all the way and it was very disappointing. The Filet was good but I've definitely had better from other places. They offer chicken fried rice for 2.50 extra and our chef drowned it in soy sauce so it almost looked like soup when he put it in the bowl. Everyone loves chicken fired rice and he just ruined it! 

The best part is when they toss the shrimp to see if you can catch it in your mouth. If your lucky enough you may get a shot and they give you free sake. 

I haven't tried the Kobe steak yet, it is super expensive unless you are out for a special occasion. A lot of other reviewers seem to like the sushi.  I guess I'll have to miss out because I won't be coming back. I'll just keep going back to Benihana's! They never disappoint.",2

Reasonably priced for fresh, delicious vegan/vegetarian food, and it looked like they had great coffee drinks although we didn't try any. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area again!",5

Great crowd hanging out eating delicious food.  Tiny enough that you HAVE to talk to the staff, they're right next to you.  Unless you sit outside.  That might be fun, too.

wxsgORVZe7wK_Ja7c3ROKw,"I took my dog for an initial trial for the doggie daycare as I was interested in the boarding and daycare because it was recommended by my veterinary office; whom I absolutely trust. I took my dog to the Doggie District and she had a blast! She was literally smiling for almost two hours once we came home. She loved having the opportunity to play all day while I was at work! Oh, they even provided a complimentary grooming because she definitely looked so much better when I picked her up! I didn't notice it until I got in my car. Her coat was nice and shiny:) they provided a really cute detailed report about how her day was and little treats. Honestly, I was very impressed and have told lots of people about what a wonderful experience it was! My dog will be back as a regular!

ogYrt6mKZwlXmprAuBkyzA,"I've not been there myself, but my family member went there late last night with his girlfriend. They are a lovely young couple, stopped in for a drink after the show at the Opera House. They were accosted by drunken thugs at the bar without provocation, and had full glasses of water violently thrown at them when his girlfriend rejected their drunken  advances, there was shattered glass everywhere. 

My family member was attacked, they were followed out of the bar by three or more of these drunken thugs, and he was punched in the head, which required medical attention at Emerg. 

Apparently this establishment has bouncers, they were not in evidence. 

This place does not meet the minimum standard of providing a safe place to stop in for a drink. Drunken thugs apparently rule the roost, with no order imposed by security. 

I live nearby,  but never plan to visit and will encourage friends and family members to avoid this establishment for their personal safety.",1

vT5J0AQC0BZp7GKK-4NS8w,"Stayed at a deluxe room (no strip view) on Wednesday night. We got $35 price for the room, very nice! Yet, the resort fee ($25, plus resort fee tax!) is ridiculous! Our total came out to nearly $70, gee! We did not use in-room wi-fi, nor the gym, nor the printing services. When we tried using our 2-for-1 buffet voucher the next morning, we were told they weren't accepting it due to the Thanksgiving holiday! What the heck!!!?? Of course we did not eat there; no way I'm paying regular price for a mediocre buffet. We also got a 2-for-1 cocktail voucher, which we redeemed at Señor Frogs there. Very weak margaritas and did not enjoy the hip-hop music; we left right away to go for a walk on the strip. 

Now, the room (on the upper floors). I enjoyed the view, though it wasn't strip view room. We were still able to see the north end of the strip. Nice view of the mountains. I enjoyed the plush bed. The bathroom is nice. The in-room toiletries are great, from the spa there. I read reviews about the nearby train being too loud. Yes, it is loud, but I didn't mind that noise too much. I did hear a couple loud people out in the hallway throughout the night; I also didn't mind that. Heck, it's drunken Vegas! :) 

We did see the Mystère Cirque Du Soleil show that night. Awesome!! First Cirque Du Soleil show we see and we truly enjoyed every second of it.",3

9YKCrYvAQ_OFl4e4LUdnRA,"I struggled with this rating.
We were told that we could sit at the bar if we wanted to sit soon and being that we had gondola tickets in 80 minutes and hunger right then and there, we chose the bar.  We were told it would be the same menu.  We are seated in what would be a very nice booth anywhere else but here they refer to it as sitting at the bar becuase its not at the main restaurant.  We are given the Cafe Menu.  I ask for the Tasting Menu and the waiter goes into this whole long song and dance about how there are two different menus and two different chefs and his chef will say no.  At this table with me is a waitress at another 4 star Vegas restaurant who totally joins me in making fun of this fool who just bascially told us we cant spend $100 a person here because we are seated on the other side of a halfwall and we can only spend a total of $100 for 3 people.  This weird waiter must work for some other reason then tips.  
In the end however, the food won out.  
The ""Liquid therapy"" menu hit the right spot with a ""Flirtini"" but not so much with the Mango Martini.  The bread served in a bag with some of the creamiest butter was simply heaven.  
The dishes were served with excellent presentation.
As they were laid out on the table, quirky waiter returns with gusto asking how everything is. Um, buddy no one has tasted anything yet.
He comes back 5 minutes later to ask again while we are all midchew. 
When we could talk we reported its goodness.  My experience with 3 or 4 cheese ravioli in a cream sauce is that the cheeses are muted.  Here however, the cheeses each came alive with each bite.  The sauce and the roasted pine nuts and chopped grape tomatoes were a perfect blend.  The pesto cream sauce needs to be finished, every last drop from your plate with the good bread.  
It's too good to leave a drop!
The couscous was light as air and the chicken fettucine was also mixed to combine but not overpower the natural tastes, so I was told.  
So it could have been the waiter that marred the experience but all in all, I would say it was very good but not as amazing as its San Francisco companion.",4

8uUEB3WtNkT5BwyqnRfQcg,"Cool atmosphere/music/crowd/decor TOTALLY ruined by the fact that my $9 Gin and Tonic was built like this: Scooping ice directly out of the ice bin with the wrong glass.

I dunno,  if I'm paying $9 a drink, at least put the whole shot in there.

Today I was out running some errands with my sister and 5 yr old. My little one was getting a little antsy, but had been extremely well behaved during our outing, so I thought I'd surprise him with a lemonade and small fry. I entered the drive thru and there were a few cars ahead of me and a few had pulled in shortly after I (so they were decently busy for a Saturday afternoon). I ordered a small fry, small lemonade, med soda and a large fried pickle (for my sister and I to share). We weren't in line long, and then we were at the window and had received our order(so far so good). I'm already headed towards the freeway when my sister pulls out my sons things and hand them to him and the pulls out the pickles, and that's when I realized they had charged me for a Large but gave me a half full small... now I've worked in service so I realize sometimes things happen when it's busy. That being said, it was extremely frustrating to not receive what I paid for. Sure it's only $5 In The grand scheme of things and we were fine sharing what we got but still extremely disappointing.

To cut the story short.. after some Fat Tuesday's we stumbled onto this place that looked interesting. It is located in the Miracle Mile shops (part of Planet Hollywood). Normally you don't expect to find really good food in a shopping center (or equivalent), but it really is one of my favorite places. I have brought friends here over and over every time I go. Every time my friends loved it. Not to mention that I watched my winning parlay ticket here.. so bonus points. ;-) But back on a serious note.. it really is a great place.. great eggplant parmigiana, same with their chicken parmigiana, and delicious gnocchi.  They also have what I believe is foccacia bread (or something super thin) that comes with cheese (Parmesan sprinkled on top) and oil and vinegar (on the side).. this used to be complimentary, but I think they charge for it now. Anyhow, highly recommended. Must try at least once!!",5

C7eTKC5HXe-E78mKsbKJoQ,"Horrible, horrible, horrible shop! Don't take your car here unless you're okay with damage when you get it back. I took it in last Monday for routine maintenance (timing belt, spark plugs and water pump). I was told it would be a 5 hour job and they would give me a good price if I brought it in that morning, so I did. I was then told at the end of the day that they needed it over night. I picked it up Tuesday night and all the service lights were on. I took it back Wednesday to have the lights reset. Then on Saturday my car completely broke down. I called the shop and they sent a tow truck. We got to the shop after hours and the manager drove by and see if he could help which was nice. Since they were closed on Sunday it would mean that I was out of a car again until Monday. On Monday I was told that they didn't know what it was and they needed the car overnight again to take everything they did apart. I got the car back Tuesday afternoon and it was finally running again but they wouldn't tell me what was wrong. On my way home I noticed a grinding/ clicking noise when I turned right. I took my car into the dealership on Wednesday because I was not about to go back to this crappy shop for my car to be damaged even more. The dealer looked it over and it had the wrong coolant put in it by them and they heard the noise too. So I had to get back to work but dropped my car off Thursday at the dealer so they could take it apart and they found a 3/4 socket that this shitty shop dropped in the sub frame and just left there. So a 5 hour job turned into 8 days without a car and extra money spent. Don't ever use this place....... oh and as an extra bonus, my phone number was given out to a mechanic.",1

mRYlfFhH9wfQGqtEpAMGvQ,"Recently attended the Classic Gaming Expo 2010 held in the hotel.   As both and attendee and as CGE Staff I can tell you both sides using the Tropicana as a convention facility and a hotel.

First the Good
Freshly remodeled rooms.  
 + Well appointed for the price you pay.
 + Mid range soaps (for the price) 
 + Quite rooms with nice glass and shutters to block the outside noise and light when needed.
 + Very comfortable beds at sheets that are at least 400 TC if not a LOT more.
 + Enough pillows on the bed(s) for anyone. No problems with bringing up more of anything you want.
 + Large flat screen TV.  pretty much normal for LV rooms.  If you watch it that is.

Nice pool area!  Not to small.  Not too big.  Lots of adults enjoying the pool and the view.   This hotel is an adults oriented hotel so there are not many kids around.  A point to consider it you travel with younger family.

Convention facilities that are pretty good in any book.  The rooms are kept cool even when the load dock door is opened.

Convention Facility managers whole will be on site and available to ensure your every need is met.  No arguments about sending down tech to adjust the sound and lighting for the rooms.  No extra charges for that service either!

Main theater and stage that is well equipped to make your convention dinner and event a success.

Valet parking that does not gouge you on either the price or the service.

Okay casino area.  Nothing fancy but it will serve your gambling urge if you have one.
The Legend's Steakhouse staff.   During our convention I need to ask the staff at Legends for more than one favor both in and out of the restaurant.  They came through admirably with exactly what I needed each time.  And they did one on time too!


The location!   Being right on the corner with New York-New York, The MGM, and Excalibur put you in walking distance of many notable things to see and do.  As you will see below the Tropicana needs these other things in order to attract people to stay.




Now some negatives that really sucked.

The Food!   No restaurant in the entire Tropicana served food anywhere near to the quality needed for the price they charged.  Save one. Legend Steakhouse.   Every other eatery in the Tropicana including Bacio, Havana Go Go, South Beach Cafe, etc, served mid range to crappy food I was sorry to have paid for.  Bacio in particular was a huge breakfast disappointment.  A crappy little dungeon of a place serving undercooked and watery eggs with dried and hardened mini-croissants.   I post a pic later.   The South Beach Cafe has Matzo Ball chicken soup that taste like it is straight from the can and is ruined further by being served in a paper container that falls apart minute after it arrives Suffice to say that if you stay at the Tropicana you need to plan for you meals at some other place with better food such as Denny's!

The on-screen room folios for you bill are entirely useless.  The only think offered in the current bill total and the ability to check out.  None of the details for your room are presented.  The Tropicana's folio system smacks of a 1980's computer throwback that is in need of a urgent update.

The parking just sucked!  At the time the Tropicana was hosting three conventions, Rollercon, Buffalo Soldiers, and Classic Gaming Expo.   While the convention facilities were handled well, the parking problems could have been mentioned before we arrived.   The entire covered parking was absolutely full when I arrived on Friday morning at 7 AM and remained a real bitch all the way to Sunday!  The Tropicana needs to build an new multi-story structure in the other flat lot to alleviate the parking issues!

The various WiFi rates.   Now I know we don't come to LV to surf the net.  Well not unless you were going to that kind of convention anyway.  But I have to say the Tropicana's rate are really over the top in this day and age of free WiFi as an expected room amenity to keep in touch.  The Tropicana's rates are:
$14.95 / day  for the room areas.
$16.95 / day  for the pool areas and it is a separate charge from the room areas.
$495.00 / day for the Convention Facility areas.  Yes $495/day!  And without guarantee  of usability!
The moral of the story here is to bring your own 3G or 4G mode/router with you when you stay at the Tropicana!


Overall I would count the Tropicana as a win for the room and convention facilities.  Just be prepared to walk for food and entertainment,  Thankfully those items are walking close to the Trop.  It's the only reasons I gave then three stars   But I really should have given them 1 or 2 stars.",3
HrzDeuKDMeN4-hUhtyAC2Q,"Nice way to put it would be, lots of room to improve. It's pretty much a one time restaurant. This is a franchise or chain store from Taiwan that doesn't seem to be up to par, with it's origin. Entrance is small due to it's ""special design"" therefore limiting the amount of room available for people to wait before their seating. The overall interior design is very nice, it supports their up selling purpose. At the very start, no host available at the entrance to greet. During the long wait for seating, random servers just walk up to you and remind you thats there is no seat available yet, great! Thanks for informing me about the bad news! Coat check is available but no one will offer it to you. The tea was served cold and taste very much like 茶餐廳 steeped tea. ""A"" for effort in making their dishes visually appealing, however the taste you would expect does not compare up to the price. Its like repackaged T&T cafeteria food. The waitresses are unexperienced, dropped food or spilled stuff on the table every time they deliver or remove dishes from the table. The timing of dish delivery is horrible, absolutely no system involved. You receive your food when they feel like preparing it. So you're all eating a different course at a different time. Its a nice to try once, but don't think you need to ever return. Props to the amazing service team! One star for the design and one star for the effort.",2

Life is Sweet is right passed St. Clair hospital and sits right off Bower Hill Rd with a very tiny lot, the bakery is tiny too. We were greeted by a friendly girl behind the  counter. I told her I unlocked my offer for checking in on yelp for a free 16 oz. Coffee and she was happy to pour it up. It was a good cup of coffee for sure especially on the gray and dreary day that it was. We picked a variety of sweets to try and I have to say, we will certainly stop back. Yum! I had to try the cupcakes. I got three different flavors to try. I got strawberry, salted caramel, and chocolate. The strawberry, blew me away!!! It was moist and had strawberry laced through. It was so good. The others were fantastic too. Their cake is so moist and their buttercream is so light and fluffy, it was more cool whip light and fluffy. So good! The lemon bar was great too, simple and light. The brownies are also very good. They are dark chocolate and iced. They are dense yet not heavy and the icing is not a heaping pile on top. They know how to ice without going over board. Over all just terrific! If you are ever in the area stop, it is worth it and, a side note, not expensive either.",5

Not even just to study, although the tiny shop is well suited for it.  The owner is a wonderful woman and her workers have all been very well suited to the place.  The ambiance is artsy but not elitist.

What else should I mention.....I know there's something I'm forgetting.....

Oh yeah.

Coffee.

Each cup, even of their basic coffee, is individually brewed.  Dark as midnight and strong as.....things that are really strong.  It's wonderful.  The best coffee I think I've yet found in a region that doesn't seem to like strong coffees.

7ZCsmNFQJIhckr4QtZVz7A,"This place is seriously rated as a top vegetarian eatery? In that case I could just as easily set a cardboard box up on the strip and hand out microwaved factory made patties on untoasted bread with no condiments and get the same award.
Because that is what you are paying 8$ and up for. Factory. Made. Shit.
Not even seasoned factory patties, oh no. 
For you meat eaters let me break it down for you, factory made vegan/vegetarian patties are the equivalent of the hamburger patties you get at Mickey D's and Burger King. At least there they know it's cheap crap, and you get the price for it. Here, they charge you a ridiculous price for stuff you can go to ANY store now days and buy yourself, make yourself, and it would be better and cheaper for you.
My friend brought me here, bless her soul, because she wanted to try the highly touted veggie food, since she is converting to the green side. 
So here is the meal we got after half an hour of waiting (where mind you others who arrived after us were served waaay before us):
I got the grilled chicken burger, vegan style, which consisted of the vegan patty (a very thin, small patty not big enough for the ENORMOUS bun they throw it on) with mostly iceberg lettuce and one sliver of tomato, plus thawed out Daiya cheese shreds and the most lethargic fries I've ever had. They claimed that the fries were baked, but most of them were cooked just enough to not be raw, but were so soft that it was basically a mound of unmashed potatoes. Oily too.
She got the panini sandwich, which was the same thing, just different bread. And baked chips. LAYS BAKED POTATO CHIPS. WTF!? This place claims it's organic and healthy, but they serve LAYS CHIPS here!? That shit is so processed they legally should not be allowed to put 'potato' on the bag!
The only logical reason for this place to have the reputation it does in the vegan/vegetarian world is because they have no real competition. And the location is in an area where people are too rich and lazy to make their own meals, so they go here and feel better about themselves.",2
7RRJhEu1eP2SCNiRiVxEEQ,"This is NOT Guitar Center, or Sam Ash. This is a real genuine mom & pop family business. A majority of the customers are actual working musicians. Dionne is the queen of accordion repairs, for the western United States. He husband Chuck is also a very experienced top notch electronics repair man. I don't think very many other amp techs use a curve tracer to match transistors. Yeah, this store is small and funky. Some days they have some great deals. They are one of the few if not only stores that got into the niche market for Latino music, selling Bajo Sextos, Quintos, accordions and other instruments associated with Tejano Musica & Norteneo Musica. This store is getting close to 95 years old, and still in the same family. If I need something small, or just want to drop in, this is a great place. They also have a swap meet every month that is really special, and neat. I am managing a building in another city that was home to "" an institution"". Closing it, hurts, and it makes places like Ziggie's all the more special. How many 75 year old people will say, ""Oh yeah, I bought a violin from Guitar Center back in 1959""? NONE! That is what you get with a place like Ziggies. You get a legacy, and 3 or 4 generations of real experience in musical instrument sales, & repairs. What do you get at Guitar Center? Some kid that repeats opinions like a parrot, or a know it all jerk intent on selling you some overpriced piece of junk? Dionne & Chuck are two of the bestest people on the planet! The guy with all the tattoos is okay too. Drop in, say hi, buy a little something, or not, just be sure and come back again.",5

Sat myself at the bar and began nibbling on the tapenade and breads which was excellent. I recommend the olives  burger with the truffle fries. Both were outstanding and cooked just right. For
Dessert (and I only have dessert if I've enjoyed the entree) I had the chocolate peanut which was very good. I would certainly return to olives because the service above all was outstanding.",5

EDx0Qa1LMMD7J4OmAwiK1g,Basically an overpriced stripper show. Save your money. Barely lasted an hour and wasn't very entertaining.,2
jcIyc1_zujWbyx_Mp7DP-Q,"Bellagio has its own charm, there is no doubt about it and the location in the middle of the strip, makes it even more attractive for your Vegas stay. It is beautifully decorated during the holidays. This was our second stay at Bellagio and we opted for the Strip View rooms at the Spa tower. During our first stay, we stayed at the Fountain View rooms at the Main Tower. 

First Visit  12/2016
 We loved the view from the room and we enjoyed watching the fountains from the room. 
However, we didn't like the 2 hour long wait for check-in. We used a third party website to do the bookings (didn't repeat the same mistake for our second visit). Also, we booked Fountain View Non-Smoking rooms but we were given Smoking rooms (I know!!! ). And we were told they are no fountain view rooms available that are non-smoking. Wait, didn't we pay for that. We were told that the non-smoking rooms will be cleaned to perfection and we won't get the smell. Nope- it was really bad,we couldn't even stay inside the room. Then we left the room at 11pm in the night so that the filters in the rooms can be changed. We had bookings for two rooms and same problem in both. Please don't allow people to book non-smoking rooms if you are not going to have them available when they come to check-in!!! Ridiculous. So, please call and confirm that they have the rooms available and they will be able to keep them ready when you get there. Also, don't expect this to be a 5 star experience, we have gone to other 5 star hotels and the experience here is nothing similar. 

If you want to enjoy the fountain views and not worry about the 5 star service, go to this place or else take your business elsewhere as frankly no one here cares. They have enough demand that the check-in lobby doesn't even have place for your elderly parents to sit as it is full of visitors who are roaming around. Seriously the worst check-in experience we ever had. 


Second visit - 12/2017 
My parents were visiting us from India and we thought they should be able to stay in the middle of the strip and enjoy the view of the fountains if they are not able to go around as much. We thought this time around we will have a better experience.
Check In - We were able to do mobile check-in as we did our bookings through their website this time. Again, only one room was available at 3 PM and the other room was not available until 4:30 PM.Where in the world have you ever been told that both your rooms are not ready by 3PM as we cannot always meet the check-in time. 

 We called in the morning to make sure one of the room is two Queens and not one King. We were told sure that request can be accommodated. But guess what, we got the room late and even then it was not Two Queen just one King. They didn't have one available with two queens like earlier they didn't have a non-smoking room(haha!).  We again go down running to the check-in counter (trust me going from your room to the check-in counter is a long walk!!!) to talk to them and were told they can give us a roll-away bed and that's the best they can do. We were traveling with family and didn't want to deal with this, so we just agreed to whatever. But please be sure that this is not like any other 5 star hotel where customer service is priority, here the staff is trying really hard to get by.

Oh and the saga doesn't end here. On the next day of our stay, we went out after lunch and returned after 5 hours to find one of the rooms not even cleaned. I didn't have the energy to call them and argue about it but I did leave a note to the cleaning person.  Yep, that's the service you can expect. 

So, am I going to come back to this place for its fountains - I don't think it's worth the horrible check-in experience, the long walk to the rooms and dirty rooms after paying a hefty price for the rooms. Oh, I forgot to mention, we had dining credits for the room which we had to call and get fixed when it was not automatically taken care of. Yep, please make sure your bills are fine and you are getting the rooms you booked and paid the price for. Hope others have better experience to share!",2
BGlGoueLLcKxznIRuDxAKQ,"We have had nothing but trouble with this company. The installation was sloppy and they scraped the tiles on the ground during installation. They also left low of a mess than I expected. 

Upon the first use of the grill, the knobs got so hot that I got a blister on my hand when I went to adjust the temperature. The internal temperature of the grill only showed 275 degrees at the time. They shipped me a bar to install along the back. It was simple and summer to work, but when I spent over $8,000 for the grill and island, why was this not already installed? 

The next time I used it, I left the grill on to cook off the sauce on the grates. I left it on high for about 25 minutes, though I had only meant to do so for a much shorter time. The temperature was pegged off the thermometer. The grill and tile nearby are damaged. I've never had a similar issue with a propane grill (this one was converted to natural gas). 

Finally, part of the purchase agreement was to install a ceiling fan. They did not do this at first, because they forgot. When the other team came out for the install  they did a sloppy job here, too. This allowed water into the van, destroying it. They originally said they'd replace it, if only we had purchased an external fan. When we told them that this was an external fan, suddenly they said no to anything and they are now taking long times to respond. 

I could not be more disappointed in a company. If I enter find myself in the marketplace for a grill again, I'd never do business with them.",1
OUQI42L6MiNQTCroFNQ9bQ,Have been back for takeout a few times. I am trying some different sandwiches and personal size pizzas. All were delightfully delicious.

 **I can't speak to the prime rib though. 
I know, hard to believe that a place known for its meats can't figure out the timing required to cook prime rib so that is available to order at DINNER time. 
I've come in 2 nights in a row and there was NO prime rib available at 5:30 pm. 
Must be a new manager or a new head chef. 
I'll come back again because the brisket is not a bad second choice but REALLY, no prime rib 2 nights in a row. 
Maybe they can put some tape over the prime rib label on the menu. 
Would be 4  1/2 stars

5Vqxj0TaMDRMNYwB0rO1Ag,"This was my first stop arriving in on my early morning flight from the east coast. What's not to love about a charming Parisian style bistro for a spot of brunch? 

The atmosphere here is the best, the closest I've seen to France outside of the country itself. The service was quite fast but extremely courteous.

There is a wide selection of fresh espresso ($4), coffee ($4), orange juice ($4) and other juices, as well as a well procured drink list that I didn't partake in so early, even though people nearby definitely were.

For a light meal, I chose the yogurt parfait ($5.95) and pan au chocolat ($4). The parfait was made fresh, and not something that had sat in a fridge somewhere. The pan au chocolat was fresh baked, and tasted like it was fresh out of the oven, still warm with a slight chew. I believe it had some caramelized sugar on it, but all in all it was delightful.

Overall a great place, and probably my favorite in all the places I stopped at in Vegas.",5

Fifth Ave Alterations is most definitely one of those establishments.

Great care was taken not just in measuring me for the alterations I needed, but I was also dissuaded from wasting my money on costly vintage suit adjustments that may or may not have been successful.  I appreciated the honesty, and took their advice, as those suit alterations would have been 3 to 4 times what I actually paid for the suit - something that was made clear to me.  I did, however, have two pairs of vintage slacks altered for length, and the results were superb.

Just be sure to bring cash, as you need to pay for your alterations up front, and credit cards are not accepted.",5

rygVxRWTzuZQyWy2npnItw,"they don't have maple ice cream anymore!

Anyway, I shared a waffle (fudgement day) with a friend (about $15-16) because portions are large. i don't think it was worth the price in my opinion. The waffle itself is amazing- light and fluffy, the way it should be and chocolate drizzles and chips are crunchy but the vanilla ice cream is thick, gooey and doesn't taste like vanilla at all to me. Bananas were okay, thinly slice, nothing special. I don't think i'll choose this combo again, probably a different flavour or just a plain waffle.

I was disappointed when I received a small menu and only saw beef burgers. So I decided to try the regular burger with goat cheese added. The burger came out a nice size, and the goat cheese on it was about an inch thick and covered the whole burger. I bit into it and was quite impressed. Nice and juicy, just the right amount of pink in it, and nice soft melty cheese. It went perfect with the beer. Definitely recommend, but would be better if they had what I initially came in for.",4

I had the lunch special: raw beef noodle soup and curry beef brisket on rice with a side of spring roll. 

My raw beef noodle soup was not raw. I had a couple spoonfuls of the soup and it was warm/cold. The soup was not hot and there was no steam coming from the bowl of noodle. 

The beef brisket on rice was warm-cold too. The beef brisket was a little tough and difficult to chew.

I ended up not finishing either dishes. I did not pack it in a doggy bag either. It was not good. As I left I suddenly got very thirsty - main side effect of MSG. I cannot stand MSG and somehow it did not function well with the food as it did not taste good. FYI MSG makes food tastes a lot better than they actually do. I will not be returning.",1

The ride itself is about 12 minutes long- long enough to feel like you got your money's worth but not so long that the kids get restless.  The whole family really enjoyed it a lot.

i got the build your own omelet with spinach (no cheese), which comes with choice of fruit, cottage cheese or tomato slices ( i chose cottage cheese), and also comes your choice of bagel (i had the whole wheat) all for $8.99.  the portion was pretty generous and i actually couldnt finish it all and had to take the rest with me.

JVeyrohoogHM_FLG2ZYiAg,"Hidden Basement ""Speak-Easy"" in Downtown Chandler

You first encounter a doorman at the top of the stairwell on the main floor. Then, you walk down and open the door to one of the movie type doors - you know the one where they slide a tiny window open and ask you for the password. Inside is a dimly lit no window grey brick walled room filled with lots of tables, a fully stocked bar with mixologists, jazz music, and thousands of LOUD conversations. 

On a Saturday night, this place was PACKED. For a chill speak-easy, this place had WAY too many people. There were so many people that my party of 4 were screaming across our little table to just get a gist of the conversation we were trying to have. I talked to a regular there and she told me normally it isn't that packed and you are even able to have the full attention of the mixologist/bartenders if you please. The night I went, was definitely NOT the case. 

Overall, drinks were different, good, and strong. I'd love to try more. The food was spot on. We shared the sliders and empanadas. The sliders were AMAZING. They were so stuffed that meat was spilling out of the sides with a side of tangy sauce. I HIGHLY recommend this. The pasta stuffed empenadas were good; a little soft so eat them with a fork. I can only imagine that the rest of the menued foods are just as tastes as these two.

The service was very attentive but not overbearing, and Ashley was super friendly and courteous.  Never waited for a refill on tea or anything else despite the place being fairly crowded.  The expanded inside looks great to boot.

The other bonus for this location is there are some things to do, like gaming, video games, smoking patio and full bar.  Some people get sick of watching me crack crabs for 2 or 3 hours, so they're nice distractions.  Some of the best seafood I've had in this town and at more than fair prices.

If you're in the mood for fresh shellfish, crab cakes, or boardwalk fries, this is the place.  They're a Ravens team bar during NFL, but no place is perfect, lol.",5
ab18VyRiof8F6rK3q-kvzQ,"Yum!

I loved ordering my custom poutine on the little form. It came out promptly and it was delicious. The cheese curds had that telltale squeak, the gravy was rich, and the fries were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I also opted to get bacon and jalapenos, which just brought the whole thing to another level.

The staff are sweet and friendly, which makes the dining experience even nicer.",4

7jCELzDBwU5fW2O5VIdmCw,"I did a search online the other day to try to figure out just how many craft breweries there are in the Carolina's. North Carolina boasts 150 breweries and brewpubs alone.  When you throw in South Carolina, that number likely surpasses 200.  That is a lot of brew to contemplate;  And when you consider that each brewery has an ever evolving assortment of adult beverages, it could take a person a very very long time to sample them all: which is impossible with new breweries opening weekly.

I've only been in the Charlotte area since November.  In that short time I have visited no less than 20 breweries, several dozen brewpubs, and every other type of establishment that might have a craft beer on tap.  I've sampled an ungodly amount of brews: some OK, some good, some that were laughable, and just a few that were very exceptional. The Grapevine, located just over the border in Fort Mill, has become one of my favorite stomping grounds for trying out something new as well as stocking up on beers to take home. They don't disappoint with their selection.  

The Beertopia Festival, which is organized by (and located at) the Grapevine is the big ""kick-off"" for beer week in the Charlotte area.  The 2016 event was the 8th annual and was held on March 12th. Green VIP tickets sold for $60, General Admission tickets were $39-55 (depending on date of purchase) and Designated Driver/Entry only tickets were $20. I bought my tickets back in December or early January for $39 a piece and waited patiently for the opportunity to sample from nearly 150 different beers with one small glass over a 4-hour period from 2-6 PM (if you pay for the Green VIP pass you get 1 additional hour). That is a lot of beer and no matter how well you prepare, and how many pretzels you dangle around your neck, you will never be able to try them all, so it's best to plan ahead.  They list participants from past years on their website. That's a good starting point for researching which brews are worth your time. I failed to research as much as I should have and ended up spending way to much time looking up reviews on Beeradvocate.com.  

The setup is well done.  They completely take over the parking lot just next to the Grapevine and barricade it off.  The entrance wraps around their building and a score of volunteers or staff are on hand to check your tickets, stamp your hand, and give you the customary wristband indicating your drinking eligibility. 

When you finally pass their ""security' and pickup your sampling glass and event map you walk smack dab into the event with tents occupied with the brewers completely surrounding the outside edges of the parking lot.  By this point you really should know what you are doing because the venue fills up fast: as do the lines.  

I am not going to review the individual brewers at this time.  I generally avoided the larger breweries since I can visit them often:  Sugar Creek, OMB, Legal Remedy, etc.  Instead I focused on some higher ABV brews I had not tried before from breweries like Check Six, Aviator, D9, Big Boss, and Blue Point.  Most of the smaller operations had some serious connoisseur's working the taps; made for some great and lively discussions.  I will say I really liked the Check Six.  They are located in Southport, NC: on the coast.  I liked 3 of their beers and I may just have to visit their operation one day.  

While beer was the focus of the festival, there were some other activities, including a great performance by U-Phonik, a formerly Canadian Band that relocated to Charlotte, NC in 2001.  They played a mix of alternative rock covers and originals.  There were also several eateries to visit, including Sal's Roadside Eatery, and the Woodstock Pretzel Company. Pretzels are a big thing at Beertopia.  Pretty much the only way to clear the palate from one brew to the next.  Lots of the crowd were wearing their very own pretzel necklaces.  You could also buy at the Neighbors Helping Neighbors tent.  

I have been to a lot of festivals all over the world, including ones in Austin and Honolulu.  While Beertopia is only a 4-hour event, it is definitely a one-of-a-kind and a must attend if you are in the Charlotte area.  I like the selection, the setup, the entertainment, and the value.  

Kudos! I'll be back!",5

Vf_wkDT580XnNv3ckOXkJg,"I was so excited about having the Kleinfeld experience and was so disappointed when it actually happened. After meeting our consultant, she took us through the gallery that probably had 6 dresses in my reasonable price range of $3000 and a ton of beautiful dresses I couldn't afford, we were brought to our room that already had dresses in it. She had disappeared while she left us to browse all the expensive dresses and pulled a bunch of gowns. When I started trying them on, my niece had to get up every time to straighten and fluff out the trains while the consultant stood beside me and watched. Then when I cried once I found my dress, she asked me the question, I answered, she brought Champaign then started with the sales pitch that did not stop. She was all over the 60% down and trying to sell me a HBC credit card. It ruined the experience. I couldn't even absorb the experience before she pushed and pushed. I said i needed to chat with my fiancée before spending the cash and she was like, we can call him right now and you can sign the contract and leave your credit card number and then call to confirm in the morning etc. She came up with every possible way to have a 60% down before I walked out the door. The pressure ruined everything and she didn't even bring out the second dress I came all to Toronto to try on!! I gave her two pictures of dresses I came there to try and she only brought out one. I asked a few times but she brought others. I would not recommend Kleinfelds. Its not what its cracked up to be. We went to another place afterwards and another mother/daughter there said they had the same experience as I did. The shop owner said she recommends going to Kleinfelds first, to her clients, because they always come to her afterwards so appreciative of her genuine personality and ready to buy any place other than Kleinfelds.",2
OSespjCVGC2biJXiWJGEIQ,We ordered pizza with extra cheese and cheese sticks to go.  Get back to the hotel and there's no cheese on the pizza.  I called and talked to the manager who said they would deliver an new one.  1 hour later I call and they say the delivery driver is in the lobby.  Guess who's not in the lobby.  Call again.  They're going to call the delivery driver.  He finally shows up.  These people are morons.  There's not one piece of cheese on this pizza.  I'm glad I took pictures so everyone can see how dumb these people are.  The bar staff is really rude too.  The cheese sticks came in a bag 15 minutes before our wrong pizza came too.  I used to like this place every time we came into Pittsburgh.  Never going there again!!,1
ZSMbXN9BtxuXzRhjI8hQ8A,"Was definitely not happy with the service I received here. I usually go to the Chandler location which is always awesome, but I thought I would try this loc because it's technically closer to me. Walked in and asked an employee where their juice bar was, and he answered me in a tone like I was inconveniencing him or something. Totally did not appreciate the attitude. Got in to the juice bar and the girl who took my order had the same attitude! Then when I got my drink it was hella bad. She put wayyyy too much ginger in it making it unbearable to drink. Totally sucks considering it was $10. Normally I'd even bear with it and finish something, but I just couldn't. Had to dump the whole thing.

Anyway, I would definitely recommend the Chandler location. A lot more friendlier atmosphere of employees. I do understand that having dealt with different employees could have changed my experience, but I guess that's life. Won't be going back.",2

qxkXyfrr8oALlshcvDGyxQ,"For our daughter's 3rd birthday we threw her a backyard carnival complete with a petting zoo and pony rides. I wanted a dessert that stood out but was also easy for a three year old audience. I remembered eating some Pink Box Doughnuts at work so I stopped in one afternoon. The guy working the counter told me that if I emailed the owner they could get something custom put together for me. I emailed Roberto and got a very quick response. I wanted three dozen doughnuts that went with my theme THAT weekend. It was super short notice but Roberto was very fast with all email responses and I was able to pay over the phone ahead of time, which was perfect because I wasn't sure who was actually picking up my order. For only $27 we got three dozen various doughnuts. Some with cereal and ones decorated in pink icing. I am extremely pleased with how they looked and how delicious they were! All of the kids were excited about picking out their own doughnut and the parents thought they were really cool. We stuck a big number 3 candle in the hole of our daughter's doughnut and it was so much fun. 

Thank you Pink Box Doughnuts for helping us throw the perfect party! Definitely recommend and can't wait for the next birthday!",5

1HcMEUXunX66b0OylJSY1g,"I really enjoyed the roasted milk tea with bubble and grass jelly (from Chatime inside the store).  I usually drink the original (black) milk tea.  But the roasted milk tea added a subtle flavor that was better than the original milk tea.

The original Swiss roll was really good.  The cream was light, fluffy and just the right sweetness.  The cake was soft and fine.  The black sesame Swiss roll was also very good.  I wish the Swiss rolls would have more cake and less cream.  I wanted to try the Coffee Swiss roll but decided against it because it had so much cream.  Even the original Swiss roll, which had the lease amount of cream, had more than enough cream.

Their char shu (roasted pork) croissant was very interesting.  I did not think I would like it, but I really enjoy the savory flavor in the croissant.  The salty egg bun was also interesting.  I love having salty egg in moon cakes, so I thought I would try the salty egg bun.  It was good, but it had a little too much egg yolk for the amount of bread.  Their bread did not taste as good the next day, which was a good sign.  It means the bread was made without added preservatives, just like homemade bread.",5

OVJ4jUzkb85qDJUkYlCAuw,"I had been looking at this studio and thinking about booking an appointment when I discovered a group buy deal for it.  I had a manicure done as well as a cut.

The place itself is super cute.  The decor is fun and fresh.  Antony was my stylist.  I had recently received a horrible hair cut and was looking for someone to correct it.  I told him what I wanted and we had our vision.  They only have 1 sink and it was occupied so we had to wait a bit before it was free.

He did an awesome job cutting my hair - it was exactly what I had asked for.  He also did a fabulous job styling it!  I was planning on going to the gym but decided against it because my hair looked so fabulous.  He wasn't overly chatty initially - it took him a while before he would initiate convo with me though.  Which was a little disappointing.

The person that did my manicure (forget her name!) was so friendly.  She did a nice job on my nails.

i8AkxVDTlnsn2LXx8N80rw,"I was extremely disappointed with El Milagro. I went here with high hopes of finding quality Mexican food in Pittsburgh, but was very let down. My boyfriend is from Oaxaca Mexico, the culinary Mecca of Mexico, so we've had many amazing Mexican dining experiences over the years. This was sadly not one of them. The chips and tortillas were very greasy, the quality of the meat products was low, the salsa was a strange pea-soup green (not salsa verde or guacamole) and they served my food on a burned styrofoam plate. Even the service was poor - many of the workers seemed to lack caring about the quality of the food and the environment. Please do not think you're getting ""authentic"" Mexican food just because you're eating at El Milagro. There's much better out there. It's food like this that gives a bad name to the vibrant Mexican culture and their gastronomy.",1

9lVcPiHYdA-AKlOAE4dbyg,"After writing my review, I started to get curious about just how tiny this station's playlist actually was. I wanted to know it wasn't just me, but that the small size of the station's tracks that get played over & over again was actually a verifiable fact & not just a matter of perception/opinion on my part. So I started actually researching & tracking the songs that they broadcast (I worked for a market research firm for 10+ years so I tend to be a bit of a data wonk!) Thankfully, their website keeps a record of their playlist to save me from having to actually be tuned in endlessly - I'm sure having to listen to all that repetitiveness would have driven me bat crazy! I would only tune in occasionally just to spotcheck that what was being posted on the website was congruent with what was actually played and indeed found it to be 100% accurate each time I listened.

My findings will make you cry.

First and foremost, there is very little variety in the artists that get airplay. There are only about 100 bands that this station plays. For any radio station, that's rather pathetic - but for someone claiming to be an ALTERNATIVE station, this is inexcusable! More than most other formats, alternative artists are plentiful especially considering all the various types & subgenres & eras they could be drawing from. I'll return to the subject of artists played in a moment but now let's move on to the number of actual songs this station plays...

There are only between 200-300 songs in their ENTIRE playlist. Now bear in mind, radio is a 24/7 entity & this is a distressingly minuscule number of songs for a station to have. Especially considering how there's only around 100 artists they play. TWENTY-THREE of those few artists they play have four or more songs in the playlist and three have ten or more songs played with the most being Red Hot Chili Peppers with 14 songs in rotation.

Not only will you hear the same small pool of songs played over & over but they seem to be picked by robots rather than given any conscious thought by someone who knows what they're doing - the same song or artist often gets repeated very close to their last spin.

Nauseated yet? Well, hold on to your hat, be sitting down...and maybe just to be on the safe side you may want to have a box of Kleenex or something handy you can throw up in as you read this next part. So, as mentioned out of the vast rich repertoire of alternative musicians that Alt AZ could be playing, only about 100 are actually finding their way onto the station. The lack of variety and artists they play is by far the station's biggest weakness. So with the minimal number of people you'll hear when you tune in, WHY WHY WHY are they giving airplay to people like Missy Elliott, Macklemore, and Taylor Swift? Seriously? Um, do the people running this station even grasp the concept of alternative music? These are acts that alternative music is an ""alternative"" TO! So this station - having the audacity to call itself ""Arizona's Alternative"" - not only plays precious few alternative artists, but wastes the diminutive number of its slots on singers that are the very *opposite* of alternative! Elliott and Swift get airplay but artists like System of a Down, Talking Heads, Wilco, REM, National, Clash, Interpol, Cure, Arcade Fire, Smiths, Ramones, & Tears for Fears are NOWHERE to be found? This station doesn't even play any Depeche Mode...an alt station without DM is like a roast beef sandwich with no roast beef! Hey Alt AZ, ""WHERE'S THE BEEF?!""

Wait. It gets worse. I tried contacting the station directly with my concerns & their response was completely dismissive. The #1 Rule of Business is ""Know Your Customer"". Here I am, a member of your target audience practically handing over the keys to the kingdom of how to be not just good but brilliant & they have their fingers in their ears. If this was a station with any degree of excellence, I would be the most devoted listener! But they're not only failing to give me a reason to tune in but actually giving me several reasons to seek music elsewhere! D'oh! It doesn't matter if you're a radio station, an eatery, or a mattress maker - if you have no desire or interest in giving your customer base what they want, you are Dead on Arrival & right now Alt AZ 93.3 is a corpse.

Valley fans of good alt radio have been in agony since the departure of KUKQ. Just before this station came along, two (or three depending how you consider them) different entities were working on reviving the KUKQ brand and legacy. Both gave up when Alt AZ came along since they promised to be a major alternative station on one of The Valley's strongest airwaves. Yet listening to this station for any length of time is like a big ""I've waited ages for a good alt station & all I got was this crummy t-shirt"" zonk. Alt AZ is a total slap in the face to those who've waited patiently for a decent alt station. We need a revolution...but right now 93.3 is the one who's revolting!",2

kxYWcsAJJC8MMYpVTc1Vzg,"We came in 15 mins before closing, and the asian lady working looked up with that, I can't wait to go home look. None-the-less, she wasn't rude nor unwelcoming. I can't say she was all that welcoming either. But oh well, I get. I promised the kids ice cream all day and I had a my tea crave. 

Coming from a day outdoors and being at the in-laws who live nearby...twas the perfect time to stop in. So that's what we did.

I love the vast amount of homemade ice cream flavors  being offered. Also, they even have a good amount of vegan flavors as well. Wonderful! Might sound repetitious to those who have read my other reviews, but...I live in a home of allergy central.

However, their vegan ice cream is made with almond milk so if you have a nut AND dairy allergy...well, either bust out the benadryl or thug-life it and opt for whichever flavor appeals to you. Lol. 

The minions ordered a vegan chocolate, regular Nutella banana (I know), and regular vanilla ice cream for $2.75 each. Good gosh, but it's homemade. What the hey, right? I'm not sure if a cone is an option as she automatically scooped them into a cup. She asked if I needed a lid for the ice creams which I thought is a good option for those who some reason need it.

Guess what I ordered?!?!? Wild guess?!?!?
I'm such an exciting person that I ordered a STRAWBERRY...green tea! =D lol. I was trying to be exciting by skipping the black tea for the night and going green. Skip the boba. I had a Boba Hut nostalgia because I should of gotten boba even though it isn't my fave thing to have.

The husband had the Okinawan Milk Tea with the sea salt and boba. Okinawa milk tea is equivalent to a brown sugar milk tea. But wait....waaaaay better!!! Okay, look...I don't order milk teas. Have I had milk teas? Sure have. But I'll tell you this, this has got to be theeeee bessssst milk tea I have ever had. That is a huge statement. I would drive from the north side all the way to this joint for an Okinawan Milk tea, BUT you have to add the sea salt because it's the only way I know it and it is delicious. The drink tasted creamy. That's the best way I can put it. The sweetness was on point. I completely forgot about my drink and wanted to inhale the husband's order. It was so good. 

Oh, well...as for my drink. Still think tea time has the best strawberry base. Green tea is definitely a powering flavor especially if they're using like a jasmine green tea. There was nothing strawberry about my drink, but certainly green tea-ish.

Would I return? YES! All of a sudden a trip to the in-laws has its perks. Lol. They have a menu I'd lie to stare and explore more. Didn't get to do that because the kids were overly excited like a 9 year old girl would be if she saw Justin Beiber.....but the 11 year old beiber. 

I would highly recommend giving it a shot if you need a cold treat to cool down especially during summer or are in the mood for a boba. 

Definitely kid friendly! Skip the part where you unfold the stroller and just bring the baby carrier in. But if you must and it isn't a busy day, a stroller can definitely makes its way in there. Enjoy!",4

oqP5MddjA3yt0b7QP3Gbdg,"This was my last taco place and again it was mainly because of the reviews and again, they were wrong. First, I did only try their tacos and only 3 kind, I can not review the whole restaurant, but I figure these are basic foods so if it is a good restaurant, they would get it right. Again I had the carne asada, carnitas, and marianted pork. They actually only use 1 thick tortilla soft shell instead of the two, made it a little drier, different texture, I have had these before and like before, I felt they were inferior to the two thin tortilla. The meat I could not taste because they were covered up in their sauce. I don't know if this was the norm, I definitely did not ask for it. Anyway, when you smother something with sauce, everything usually comes out tasting the same. So they all tasted similar and bleh. I gave it a two star instead of a one was for the service, very fast, food tasted like it too and two the prices were a little less than the other place. 

So I think for now I will stick to Sorenos grill in Chandler because it seems like the best around the area. Phoenix is another quest, too far though, maybe some times later.",2

cyTI-Iy9xhlM9NW5Oo6zmg,"We live in the area and had not been to the restaurant in a while.  We had 1-cup of soup ($3.00), 1/2 lb. burger (8.50), and a PLT ($10.00).  The PLT was to have an aioli on the bread per the menu.  There was an indistinguishable smear of the aioli.  When I asked Paige for more informing her the sandwich was dry, I was informed there would be an upcharge for the aioli of $.50.  She delivered the aioli and there was maybe a tablespoon of aioli in the vessel.  She said she would tell the chef about the issue. While we can afford $.50, you think they would have wanted a satisfied customer especially since the menu says the aioli is on the item and it was not.

We most likely will not return.  If they have to pinch pennies like this, we will spend our money elsewhere.",2
NmQm_Hul1qS4WoeF1rvhdQ,"Came in & sat at the bar again for dinner.  Bartenders are helpful when you can get their attention.  I think if I was on display (behind a bar) as they are...I would be more circumspect about discussing the tips I get, what I did last night (:O) etc...

My pasta dish was really spectacular though!  It was the Lobster & Shrimp Ravioli with Crab Insalata.  Very well stuffed ravioli, cooked perfectly!  The crab insalata was some yummy dark greens dressed with a light viniagrette & plenty of yummy chunks of crabmeat.  

The tomato sauce really was the best though...very bright, creamy with a slight smoky sweetness.  Chunks of stewed tomatoes throughout (but not stewed down to mush).

I'd definitely recommend this dish.",3

FubHD3aay8aP4f6mY7Liog,Ill be definitely moving out of this place ive lived here for almost 3 yrs and have never been late on rent and recently it just getting worse. So rents due on the first right if i on line pay and the 1st is on a sunday tell me why in the hell do i have a 5 day notice to pay rent or vacate on the 2nd when in my lease it could wait till the 4th. This is some slum lord crap. I was also charged for rental insurance by the office which i have never had a lapse in coverage and when i brought it up to management i was told they couldnt take it off. I know its just 10 dollars but its the principle. Im just feed up with this place to all u prospective residents move somewhere else,1
cXZSqngnJTB_pObhSPxuNA,Took my car to them for some front end work when I skid on snow into a curb. Actually would have been happy with them if they had done the job right but ultimately they didn't and did not stand behind the parts they put in my car. Said the part only had a one year guarantee and by the time I go time to see them it was  a few months over. First of all who orders parts with a one year guarantee when the standard from the dealer is lifetime. Said they would have to charge me for a new part and install even though it was only about 14 months old . Really ? Why would I have them do this again when they couldn't do it right the first time? Eventually needed some other work and took it to the dealer. Had them look and listen to the part making noise. They replaced the part and told me it looked to them like it had never been changed to begin with as what they pulled out was original to the car . Now I know why they wouldn't stand behind their work. My advice is any parts they say they replace ask for the old parts back which they did not do for me. By the way the dealer fixed it right and it has not been an issue since.,2

So many times we have been stuck in the game because even though we had the combination of the lock, we didn't know how to actually open it and we weren't resetting it properly.  Here, they actually told us what locks are there and how to open/reset it.  This was super helpful!

As for the actual room itself, we got the Cops and Robbers and it was pretty fun.  It was different all the time.  It even involved memorizing and other things we had to do to get out.  All the other ones I've been to are just locks and puzzles, this one had way more variety of things to actually do.  I highly recommend this place.",5

BLq47iE-6Y_slU6TdxdwfQ,"How does this place only have like a half dozen reviews? As a Sicilian, if I want Italian, I cook it. When my realtor insisted I try this place, I thought, ""well I am hungry, and the fridge is empty..."" and so off went the boyfriend and I. 

Louie, the owner, was there. He spied us immediately and wanted to know our story. Apparently this is a place for regulars. We fit right in. This guy is THE MAN. He was so nice, and so welcoming, as was his large and loud Italian family that were dining there that night. Hey, these are my people. We love to eat, we love to talk, and we love our wine and dessert. Moonlite has it all; atmosphere, food, family, and a full bar. The employees are good people. The bartenders know their stuff. I suspect close to everything is homemade down to the croutons in the salad (and if not it tastes the part) and the desserts are too (not there, they order them locally, which is also awesome!)

I would never have found this place. It looks like nothing special from the outside, and nothing too fancy on the inside either, but who cares? It's delicious, and I love coming here. I have probably tried everything on the menu at this point and that's not an exaggeration. Everything is good, simple, and perfectly done. It's exactly what Italian should be. AUTHENTIC with HUGE portions. Suck it Olive Garden, I never liked you anyway. 

Seriously, check this place out.. It's a gem. Simplicity is key in good Italian cooking and they nail it. The veal is perfect every time, the zucchini mountain is spot on, and all the pasta dishes are great. Try the Sicilian dinners too; if you know the difference between Sicilian and Italian, you will definitely appreciate them.",5

KUBQAI-M1MR1VQ3cBjUB3g,"Stopped by Arcadia Tavern tonight around 9:15 pm and it was packed... Granted, it was a perfect evening to be outside for an August night in Phoenix.  The entire patio was full, the bar area had not an empty seat, and from the looks of it, the restaurant was doing some decent biz as well.  Jack Young was the singer/guitar player rockin' the place with tunes from Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Jimmy Buffet, and more.  

I'd already eaten dinner, but Jared shared a bite of his miso salmon (with rice and asparagus) and it was delicious.  I'm writing this update partially to let it be known that this is just one of the new menu options along with chicken parm, steak salad, edamame, roasted chicken with mashed potatoes, caprese, chopped, and cobb salads.  I guess the feedback made its way to management... I am pleased with the new variety of healthy choices.  Robert, the Chef, came out to say hello - or perhaps we caught him red handed having a drink at the bar... either way, it was nice to see him. 

I'll be back on my own sometime soon to order my own miso salmon... and if not me, you'll likely find Jared drinkin' a Guinness at the bar.  Cheers!",4

eS1aTz72aI1Xow1FSGR-Fg,"I was looking for a long term auto detail company who prided themselves in quality customer care and could do the job right the first time. My old auto detailer retired and sold his business so I needed another. I found Elite Mobile Detailing online and decided to give them a chance. Since I have several vehicles, I decided to give them my dirtiest as a test to see how well they detailed cars. I scheduled the appointment for 10 AM on a Friday.

I will start with the pros:
1) Carpet and seats were very clean despite being dirty. They did a nice job.
2) Exterior paint looked fantastic. Most of all the surface scratches were removed with very little spider webbing. 
3) Detailers were nice.
Now with the cons:
1) They were late! This is a big part of customer service for me. They called me a few minutes before my appointment time and said they would be late 45 minutes. They arrived at my house an hour and ten minutes late.
2) Bottom 2 inches of windshield was left dirty. 
3) Instrument panel was missed
4) Emergency brake was missed
5) Wheel wells were not done
6) Wheel covers were not completed (2 out of the 4 had significant buildup and old dirt)
7) Middle section of roof not polished
8) The carpet took 2 days in 100 degree plus weather to dry out.
9) The inside of the car reeked like mildew after the car dried out.
10) Customer service is absolutely horrible

I contacted Christian, the owner, when his employees arrived late. He said that they were running late from another job and that was normal. I asked what he could do to keep me happy since I was very upset that they were more than an hour late. He said he could discount additional services. Discount!! I spent many years in customer service and one of the first things a manager should do to defuse this situation is offer 1) a discount in the original service price or 2) throw in a free service, not a discount. 

I tried to get a discounted cleaning because they were late and Christian told me absolutely not. He simply offered to either clean the seatbelts for free, or the headliner. I asked about the engine compartment and he said he would discount the service but would not do it for free. I clean my engine around four times a year and it wasn't even dirty. 

We went back and forth and Christian agreed to do my seatbelts free of charge. I told him that I was upset and the reasons why I was upset. Christian did not want to listen and was very argumentative making excuses for every comment I had. 

I allowed the detailers to do their job and they did well. However, after a more detailed inspection, I noticed the aforementioned issues. Most of them were not a big deal but the biggest issue and the one I am frustrated about came after the car dried out. The smell was horrific and unbearable. I went out and bought an ""odor bomb"" which helped but the smell has not completely dissipated. After two days, the small is back. 

I called Christian back and left a voice mail. Christian than called back and spoke with my wife. He was very argumentative and said the smell was because the carpets were dirty. What? Are you serious? I have had my cars detailed several times and I have never smelt this mildew smell. He said he could come and fix the smell...for a price. It was his companies fault the car smells and he wants to fix the problem by charging me more money to get rid of the smell they caused. Seriously?
My wife was very upset because he was not willing to fix the issues for free. He wanted us to pay to fix the issues.  

I spoke to my previous detailer who retired and asked him what he thought was going on.  Without hesitation he said ""oversaturation of the seats"". He explained the carpet will dry out relatively fast but if the seats are oversaturated, the surface of the seats may dry but the pad beneath will remain wet, causing the smell. 

I am absolutely dumbfounded that he would charge to fix the smell that was caused by the carpet cleaning. If you read through the negative comments about his business, you will quickly realize that Christian does not take responsibly, he will blame the individual customer.  On several reviews Christian stated ""On My Company (((WE GUARANTEE OUR SERVICES!!!)(THE SATISFACTION WITH OUR COSTUMERS IS OUR TOP OF PRIORITY!!!"" If it was your top priority, you should fix the issues (for free). If you guarantee your services and you fall short of accomplishing those services, you should fix it. That is simple.",1

They are punctual and gear to take orders, refill drinks, and clear plates. But it's not the service that I'm disappointed with, it's the quality of the food. Much of the fish served here is precut and unfortunately I was getting slices that ranged from fresh looking and tasting, to old and tasteless. The amount of rice they give with the nigiri is crazy. The rice had a slight mush to it with little flavor. The worst had to be the masago (smelt roe) and the scallop. The Masago was mushy and didn't have any texture you would expect from fresh fish roe. The scallop was clearly premade hours before and left to sit. It's up in the air whether I am returning or not.",2

She eventually went to the bar to get her water herself. My friend and I ordered the macaroni and cheese. There is an option of types of cheese, and at first I thought my choices is what caused the blandness of food, but my friend chose different cheeses and her meal was just as bland. 
Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals. Two people in our party got the blackened catfish and they enjoyed their meal.

In my opinion, the wait staff needs to be more attentive to their customers and needs to be either letting us know the food will take longer to cook, or get the order in right away.",1

         Mount Charleston may be a celestial forest up in the clouds that has a 3,000 year old tree, forests, majestic mountains, springs, caves, skiing, and unspoiled nature. However, one thing that Mount Charleston doesn't have is Starbuck's. In recent times when I drove US 95 to Mount Charleston, I'd exit the freeway at Durango Drive, make a right turn then turn into the Albertson's Plaza after the traffic light. 

         When I visit this Starbuck's I cross traffic that gives the freeway a run for its money. It's Starbuck's drive thru traffic. From my observation, this is a consistently busy drive thru. Under this business listing, I posted a picture of traffic backed up to the end of the Strip of stores. After cautiously crossing the cue of stopped cars, I pass outside tables that are filled up. When I make my way inside this skinny cafe, there are usually a few people ahead of me. Starbuck's Mania is running hot at this location. Just like my coffee. 

      Before escaping the city for the Fall foliage of Mount Charleston, a coffee with pumpkin spice syrup sets the tone of the adventures that I am about to partake in up in the mountains above Las Vegas. In September, Autumn harvest is the brew cooking in Starbuck's. From Pumpkin spice cookies to Pumpkin spice Frappuccinos, the lobby screams Autumn harvest. 

    At the point of my journey between my originating point in Henderson to my destination in the clouds; Starbuck's gives me a place to relax. In a few minutes my feet will be getting a lot of use hiking. At a comfortable table or sofa seat, I cherish savoring the taste of pumpkin spice coffee while the caffeine entering my blood stream will keep me alert for many hours in the hiking trail. This public living room is my last chance to connect with civilization compliments of free WiFi before my cell phone reception disappears in the forests up in the troposphere. 

    In addition to being the closest Starbuck's to Mount Charleston, it is near Tulle Springs at Floyd Lamb, Desert Wildlife Refuge, and thousands of rooftops in the Centennial corner of Las Vegas. 

  Lately when I have driven US 95 to Mount Charleston, the best part of waking up has been this Farm Road Starbuck's coffee in my cup.",3

Schnitzel was also hearty and generously portioned. Debracyna sausage left me slightly underwhelmed, or maybe it just got lost in the crowd of other eats.

However, I discovered that the space at the next door Olive and Ivy marketplace can be shared even though you eat at modern burger!!!! Hurray. 

Another tip for travelers, the wait is about 15-20 minutes during meal hours. So gauge your flight timing!! 

Finally, on to the food. I got the breakfast burger - bacon, fried egg, patty, lettuce, tomato and delicious mayo like sauce. It wasn't my favorite  burger BUT I would definitely try it again next time. The fried egg was a little too cooked for my liking but it wasn't noticeable. You can also get extras or tell them to cook your meat a certain way or remove some toppings. My favorite part of the burger was the sauce!!!! The bread was alright.. Kinda soggy. Not the worst though. 

I also got the fries. Mmmm not my favorite and I wouldn't recommend it. Fat and soft. And although it might just have been sitting out for 10 minutes, it was cold when I got it. :(

Overall really good for airport food standard.",4
kqYRnoPLUZXh0JBGNij8KQ,"Landmark was basically a VIP cineplex theatre but for less than HALF the price. The seats recline and are so comfortable. Also, the theatre was very clean. I don't think I'll be going to cineplex again. This is probably THE best theatre ever.",5
Btsd7-y9s3f0abmF5uJLWg,"One of my rare 5-star ratings and we just love going here.  It is so much like Italy, from decor to layout to service to food and options that you are certain to enjoy it.

Be warned so you don't have a super wait by making a reservation.  They have an automated system Open Table on Yelp! so all you do is choose time, date and number in your party.  What will come up is what reservations are actually available around the time you choose.  They are very popular so don't bitch about a wait if you did not plan ahead.

The owner seats you, pulling out the chair for your women.  I started to and he asked, joking and friendly banter, if i was trying to put him out of a job.  I told him no, just didn't want to look like a helpless chump.  We got along fine.

I don't think this is a kid place unless your children/grandchildren are restaurant savvy, able to draw, play with their characters or other things and do so quietly.  Wandering around would neither be appropriate or acceptable.

Full bar and decent pours and portions.  Wine list and plenty of by the glass options.

Specials offered along with a set meal option.  Main menu will have plenty to satisfy you.

We split a salad on this occasion and it was not enough.  Decent portion for one, but not for two.

We both ordered the rigatoni with short rib and sausage and it was, tritely put, ""to die for.""  Nothing to complain about at all.

Little Waxhaw is becoming a tony place for Charlotte-tonians who are escaping the hell of Mecklenburg County.  Excellent neighborhoods are coming in and a Del Webb Sun City (Carolina Lakes) is close to 4000 retired seniors who have the time, money and interest in good restaurants, so more are coming.  

Mama Lena's  and Rippington's are other Italian restaurants located in Waxhaw's downtown area..",5

The bartenders are on top of their game, they kept the place clean, the drinks picked up and refilled and even the messes picked up all of it in a very timely manner. They are gay friendly which makes it to me one of the best bars ever!. They have karaoke 5 days a week, the food is great, the drinks are priced right. I will definitely be going back and possibly planning a party there. The host of karaoke was awesome!. Loved this place",5

Since it was a traditional NY style deli, I of course had biscuits and gravy.  I will say, the cream gravy was very good, had chunks of sausage in it.  Could have used a little more pepper.  The knish was good, but too thick for me.  It was crunchy and had good flavor, but if it were thinner, it probably would be the best I have ever had.  Service was great, although I went before 8 AM.  So, not even close to 1/2 full.  The deli case looked awesome, I wish I lived closer.  Given the drive, probably won't come back that often, but we certainly will come back some.  It's worth a half hour drive.",4

Their hot wings with standard sauce were outstanding. I was surprised that their twin peaks burger rocked pretty good; i destroyed it and the fries. All said better than average. Next time I'll be hammering out more wings... Gordon Ramsay's BurGR & fries were better, but 40% more....",4
YqPWkJs96K3PgnXYQ5TmAA,"Overall:
1. good amount and style of fries
2. chicken breaded and fried well, was hot and hadnt been sitting out. not too much grease either
3. lemonade was good on flavor and amount of sugar, but was a bad water/lemon juice ratio, too watered down
4. the bread they give you is strange but good, a bit too yeasty though and not toasted enough, even by my standards
5. the sauce was good, definitly need to give ~50% more for the perfect amount for a 4 piece meal, the sauce tastes a bit like sweet black pepper and ranch, i like black pepper and so it was nice with the fries and chicken, i could see someone who hates pepper not liking it tho
6. their iced tea was just like regular lipton but a bit stronger, meh/10 but would please most customers
7. coleslaw is shit and i hate it so maybe it was good but i just dont like coleslaw
8. the service was good, in between a sit down dining and straight up fast food, they bring your food by name and clear it for you, very nice touch. the manager seemed nice but that varies per store
9. quick and fresh
8. strange music and asthetic, disco ball + lights were a nice touch
10. good prices.
11. i didnt use the bathroom but i should have to rate that too. 

damn i should put this on yelp or google reviews fuck 4/5 overall tbh",4

I have to test my will power to not eat their delicious muffins and baked goods, my favorite, probably the carrot raisin-nut loaf.

luam5Vs71_OiA_0HGbWgRQ,Dr. Guymon is amazing. I first brought my kids for cleanings and then for problems. He's done root canals and crowns for my middle child and was always concerned about his comfort first and foremost.   Last year my son chipped a tooth on the playground at school and was in a lot of pain. Dr. Guymon came in on his day off and repaired the tooth and gave me his cell number in case there were any other problems that arose from the repair.  I would recommend him to everyone.,5
VjMShUE8tVAj5dbduPztjQ,"During our recent visit to Pittsburgh, I really wanted to try this place again.  Our first visit last year was great and there were more items on the menu I wanted to try.  It did not disappoint!  We had Italian Wedding soup that was wonderful and my wife just had to try to re-create this when we got home.  Their greens and beans is a special treat, with lots of flavor -- an excellent side dish for my main dish, spaghetti and meatballs. Now I would not usually order this at most ""Italian"" restaurants, but Chef Dan does an excellent job with perfectly cooked pasta, a fresh marinara sauce, and a huge, tasty meatball.  And to wrap up, I just HAD to have the caramel apple pie a-la-mode.  I don't normally have dessert, but I've SEEN and HAD this pie before.  Yummy!  The warm homestyle atmosphere does not prevent me from feeling ""special"" when I dine here. The staff treated me like family and I'll be visiting again!",5
REiAUiAeXBQ-owMEkmewGQ,"This place needs more reviews - I am the fourth.  I had a decent meal here while in town for my company.  I might not have stumbled on this restaurant if it hadn't been for a coworker who ate here previously.  It is basically an old house near the water (is that a lake or a river across the street?) converted to a restaurant.  They can host groups on the second floor.  We ate downstairs and it was pretty dead for a Wednesday night during winter,  I sense that they may be busier during the summer/warmer months.

The overall theme is italian and they have several varieties from the ""boot"" of Europe.  They have different variations of red sauce, plus olive oil treatments, with different pastas.  They offer chicken, veal, seafood and steaks.  Oh and they offer pizzas, which we decided to share a pizza (they are personal sized) and then have entrees.

The server brought a ""free"" appetizer of small sliced bread with melted cheese and tomato sauce on it.  I don't know when these were made, but after one bite I wasn't going to spoil my dinner with this free offering.

I had a glass of the house Chianti, which was quite flavorful.  However, the second glass I ordered with my meal tasted quite a bit different - a bit musty.  I asked our server - nicely - if it was the same bottle, or even the same wine.  I think I flustered him because he stammered out ""bien sur"" (of course).

Beyond the margarita pizza, I had a fettuccine with gigi sauce.  It really was the highlight of the meal.  The pasta seemed fresh and the server said it was homemade.

I can't say I would make this an out of the way stop, but I don't recall many other choices in this area of the Island of Montreal.  I feel this place strives for something better.",3
uV4qzwJSK02Hby_izWMqqQ,"i decided to try this since it was a full service wash. I told the attendant that greeted me it was my first time here. I asked what the prices for a wash were since they were not posted. He said 5 dollars for a wash and immediately tried to sell me a 40 dollar wash. I asked him what else they offered. I settled on a wash, vacuum and clean the interior window. that cost 12.99. During our entire conversation he was extremely rude. I went inside to wait for my car. at this point i asked the cashier how much was the candy. She said very rudely that it was marked.(in fact it was by a SMALL white sticker that you can barely see. It was way over priced, but that i expected) it took them 25 min to wash, vacuum and clean the windows. I was then told it was done. I went outside to look at the car. The first thing i noticed was there was still bird droppings on one of my windows. I then looked over the whole car. It was still dirty. I grant you that the car was clean, but there were MANY small dirt spots all over the car. The person that i told about the bird dropping did a half-assed job of cleaning it off. He then asked how he did. I told him it was only an ok job. he seemed to be offended. After i got into the car i also noticed that the inside of my windows was also smeared and streaked. I would have had them redo my entire car but by their attitude i wasn't going to trust that something wasn't going to be done to the car. I will never go back and i will tell everyone i can to avoid this place like the plague. probably the worst car wash i've ever been too.",1

Not a good dinner for us. The customer service was like if we didn't exist we weren't acknowledge  or anything . I know it was somewhat late but we're paying customers .

1bNzCTt_qtK3s12ZczXBaw,"Stax just didn't stack up.  Maybe I have high expectations -- I see burger and I think big and juicy.  This little burger was neither.  Sure, it was cute and little and had good toppings -- cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and mushrooms, but the burger itself left much to be  desired.  I don't splurge on burgers often -- I'm talking calorie-wise -- and while I didn't have to feel too guilty about the few ounces of beef  I consumed, I didn't exactly get my burger fix satiated either.   At first glance, the prices seem pretty good.  But, if you're a big guy looking for a BURGER, (like my husband), you'll probably walk away disappointed.  And at four to seven dollars a pop, more than one can get a little pricey.

The sweet potato fries were good and they came wrapped in brown wax paper in a cool little wire basket.  The restaurant is hip-looking and fun and does have those floor to ceiling glass doors that slide back, creating an indoor/outdoor restaurant perfect for Arizona's weather.  Might be a good burger place to visit with the girlfriends!  Or for a quick snack before you head out to the bars.",3

I have been there twice in the past week, as a matter of fact.  The food and wine have always been solid, not exceptional, but service has been great and I love that you can actually have a conversation without being drowned out by others or loud music. Previously, I would have given a 4 star rating  but down graded after a disappointing experience tonight. I ordered a bocconini and proscuitto salad on arugula. Arugula is a pretty hardy green that lasts for a long time, so I was surprised that about 1/3 of the leaves were actually slimy. I ate the bocconini and proscuitto and then realized how bad the arugula was. I pointed it out to the server who apologized and gave me a small green salad instead. The bill arrived with the full $16 price for the original salad from a new server. I mentioned to her that I had sent it back and she said that the proscuitto and bocconini were very expensive so she could only give me 50% off. It really isn't about the $8 but the principle and the way it was handled. Not a good way to retain loyal clientele!",3

The bread is outstanding and we've even bought the day-old a few times and brought it home to put in the freezer.  Awesome to make garlic bread for pasta dishes with!

The service at every JJ's is always great (barring one experience at the Lake Mead Parkway location) - but this one is particularly friendly...so even though I have one a little more convenient to me...I'll still go the extra 1/2 mile to my Sunset JJ's 9x out of 10.",5

D-AjY6-P0Wb1HMe7HxYAyQ,"I paid a total of $3,000 for both my daughters to have Ultherapy. During the consultation we would told that Ultherapy ""lasts forever."" Imagine my surprise during follow-up visits when I learned that this is not true and that the procedure needs to be done over and over again (preferably annually) for any kind of lasting results. I was very specific when I asked how long the results last. ""Forever"" replied the nurse. One daughter had fairly good results and the other daughter had marginal results at best. I am very upset by the dishonesty of this office in misleading us to believe that this was a ""one time procedure."" Neither daughter was examined by a physician. Consultations and the actual procedure are administered solely through office personnel. While we were pleased with the professionalism and skill of the office staff we were NOT happy with being told that Ultherapy would only need to be done ONCE. 

$3,000/per year x 10 years = $30,000

rXG_uGVpjyfUVQl-as_7XA,"I did not stay at the New York New York, so I cannot speak for the rooms.  We stayed at the Aria, but went to the New York New York casino 3 different times during our trip!

We first stopped in just to look, and then were instantly sucked in by the pizza right by the front door. It was SO GOOD. Maybe it was the serious hunger that was taking over our group at that point, but it was delicious. 

The casino here was excellent.  While stuffing our faces with pizza, we noticed the ""$5 Blackjack, All Day, Every Day"" sign.  Blackjack was our game, and we couldn't believe that $5 tables existed.  ALL DAY.  We noticed that many other hotels began the morning with minimums at $10, then raised them during the day.

I wanted to write this review to specifically thank the manager that assisted us that day (June 21st).  The casino was busy, and we were walking around aimlessly for the $5 tables. We stopped to ask someone to direct us to the area where these tables were. We assumed we were going to get a quick point in a direction, but that we did not.  A manager (I'm sorry if that's not what they are called- the ones in suits who stand behind the dealers is who I'm talking about!) took the time to walk us ALL THE WAY over to the tables.  He engaged us in conversation the whole way over, and when we got to the tables he discovered that there was not 4 open seats for us to all play together.  He made his way over to an open table, a $15 blackjack table, and had the dealer let us all play for $5!  I was amazed at how kind this man was to us.  I did not catch is name unfortunately, but he was a shorter man who was bald and wore glasses! When there are plenty of gamblers spending WAY more money than we were, we were so impressed to receive this kind of service.

Next time we are back in Vegas, I will be sure to visit the New York New York again! (And hopefully win some more on those $5 tables!)   Thank you for the wonderful experience!",5
Fl9Nx6KYyA1fuJJjirGN8Q,"Came here on Saturday evening with my husband and a friend. We had reservations for 8pm. 

This place is soooo tiny but a great atmosphere in side! Our table wasn't ready yet, but they gave us complimentary glasses of sangria while we waited. 

Once we sat down, we ordered the pitcher of sangria, which was about two glasses of sangria for each of us. 

We decided to stick with all tapas for the night and ordered 6 different tapas (We ordered them two at a time so they came out in intervals). Probably could have done with only 5 because we were all crazy full at the end of it all. Note: you receive olive oil and dipping bread complimentary.
-Croquettas- I read online that these were delish....didnt let us down! The order came with 3, so we each got one.....Though, arguably I could have eaten 20!!! Warm, ham-cheese-potato mix inside! These may have been the highlight of the night.
-Pan de Tomate- The serving for this was 4 pieces of bread with a tomato spread on top. We probably could have skipped this....it was good but nothing amazing.
-Stuffed Peppers- These were stuffed red peppers. Not sure what the filling inside was but I know it was in the vegetarian section of the menu. Very good and I recommend. There were 3 peppers.
-Chorizo with onions- This was my friend and husband's favorite dish. Super caramalized onions with perfectly cooked slices of chorizo. Very good. There was plenty for the three of us.
-Eggplant Bruschetta-  Very good.....super garlicy! There were either 3 or 4 of these....keep in mind I was 3 glasses of sangria in (plus the cosmo from earlier!!!)!
-Clams in red sauce- Perfect end. The claims were cooked perfectly. We actually kept taking the bread from the table and dipping it in the sauce because it was that good. This portion size was very large for tapas. 

Will absolutely return. Great food and good atmosphere. Just make a reservation because it isn't a large venue",4

They were also the first to come out and give a quote.  The owner came out himself, we had a good chat and after I had the quote in hand I mentioned that I was going to decide after a couple more quotes.  He gave me some advice on what to look for in the other quotes; suck as type of chemicals used and length of guarantee.  Good solid advice. 

The other quotes came in and Bee Logic won the bid.

They came out within days as planned.  They communicated often and clearly and did the work as expected.

g2DCazgncPIJfGIHa6J4aQ,"I had a very negative experience at this place today. I ordered a custom salad to go and paid all 16 dollars or so for it. Waited a few minutes and a salad was handed to me. Thankfully before I left I looked in the bag.  It was a completely different salad than what I ordered. I advised them and they apologized. A few minutes later I got my salad. 

When I returned home and started eating the salad, I noticed there was something that I could not chew. I took it out of my mouth. It was a black twist tie.  So that wasn't good.  I did, however, continue eating until I ran into two separate onions (which I did not order) and a sliced mushroom (which I did not order).  

I understand how the latter two could possibly happen. Obviously the twist tie is another story. I will not go back to this place and hope that the next person who finds a twist tie in their salad doesn't swallow it. 

I've tried to include a picture of the aforementioned three tasty items but I can't. I will add it to the pictures section for the restaurant.  Ricarda's will surely be happy to have it there.",1

I also recommend the buffalo wings but get the sauce on the side. It is definitely one of the best in Vegas. It is cooked right, the skin is very crispy which I like.",4
MzpHhBZBbFD8XX87cLn41g,"This is a great company all around. The office staff communicated with me throughout the entire process of moving from booking us all the way to Marv, Alex and Ben arriving at my home. These 3 were exceptional and worked as a great team to get me moved into my new place very fast and efficiently. They took care of everything from taking apart and putting back together our furniture to wrapping up the TVs and mattresses. True professionals. If I can leave more than 5 stars I would. Thanks again you guys, literally can't knock them in anyway, wish I could lol. You would be a fool to not choose them over competition let's just leave it at that.",5

GLOlxzmqu7oXWIGsxZVR1Q,"Had very few problems here over the years I've been going, Tanya at the first drive through window has always been cheery and it helps put me in a good mood for the morning.  This morning they had a guy spraying off the drive through at the busiest time so I'm not sure if the manager was confused but it definitely want the best time for that.  Food is usually fresh and service usually snappy.",4
yv_fpTt9AxxOWqSqxzVJeQ,Absolutely delicious donut. They have big and fluffy donuts. You can choose your own fillings in your round donuts. They are not stingy putting out fresh donuts. The donut place is behind Chick fil a. The donuts are not overly sweet. I will definitely be back plus it is not overly price.,5
